/*
 * Reading an Australian nutrition information panel into macros.
 *
 * Ported from MacroTrack's `domain/NutritionLabelParser.kt` and its 12 JUnit
 * fixtures. The Kotlin original was deliberately written with ZERO Android or
 * ML-Kit imports so it could be unit-tested against plain fixtures; that
 * property is the whole reason this file survives the camera decision. The
 * OCR engine is a native module this workspace cannot currently build (see
 * `screens/nutrition/LabelScanner.tsx`), but the parse is pure, and the parse
 * is the part that took the fixtures to get right.
 *
 * TWO ENTRY POINTS, ONE READER.
 *
 *  - `parseLabelLines` takes positioned lines, as an OCR pass produces them.
 *    Nothing in this repo calls it yet; it is what a future camera hands in,
 *    and it is tested so that day is a wiring job rather than a rewrite.
 *  - `parseLabelText` takes the panel as plain text, as a human types or
 *    pastes it. This is what ships now.
 *
 * Both reduce to rows of CELLS and run the same reader, so the manual path
 * cannot drift from the camera path.
 *
 * THE RULE THE WHOLE FILE OBEYS: a field this cannot read is left null. It is
 * never guessed, never carried over from a neighbouring row, never defaulted.
 * A wrong macro is worse than a blank one, because a blank one gets typed and
 * a wrong one gets eaten.
