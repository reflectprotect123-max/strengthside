 * Coordinator was deleted. It never belonged to the Coordinator in the first
 * place — it is arithmetic on a date, not arbitration — and it outlived it
 * because the COACH's week is keyed on a Monday too: `arc-coach-week`,
 * `ecosystem.ts`, `sync.tsx` and `ArcCoachWeekCard` all call it, and none of
 * them ever asked the Coordinator for anything.
 *
 * UTC, deliberately, for the reason `monthGrid` gives below. Note this is NOT
 * the same function as `apps/web/src/coach/coach-week.ts`'s
 * `weekStartOfLocalDate`, which answers the LOCAL question — "which week is
 * the coach in right now" — and exists because formatting a local date through
 * `toISOString()` converts to UTC first and hands back the previous day
 * anywhere east of Greenwich. Two questions, two functions; do not collapse
 * them.
