   * MAGNITUDES head to head, so this is still a heuristic. The change is from
   * one convention to a more conservative one on advice, not from a guess to a

   * progression, not increment sizes, so it cannot justify any percentage.
   *
   * WHY A PERCENTAGE AT ALL, when a flat 2.5 kg sits inside the ACSM band for
   * most working weights: because it does not mean the same thing at both
   * ends. The review puts it plainly — 2.5 kg is 10% at 25 kg, 5% at 50 kg,
   * 2.5% at 100 kg and about 1.4% at 180 kg. A global "add 2.5 kg" quietly
