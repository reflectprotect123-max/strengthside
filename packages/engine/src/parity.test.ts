/*
 * Where the port drifted from the vanilla app.
 *
 * The golden vectors pin the functions the harvester could reach; these are the
 * ones it could not — zone banking, the movement list, and the merge paths that
 * only run at the edges. Every expectation here was read off the corresponding
 * function in the root `app.js`, which remains the specification and the
 * rollback path.
 *
 * THE GUIDED-LOGGER PREFILLS WERE THE OTHER HALF, and they went on 15 August
 * 2026 with `prefillPrimary`/`prefillSecondary` themselves. Worth being plain
 * about what that costs: this file was pinning the port against the vanilla
 * app, and eighteen of its assertions were about a screen neither product
 * ships any more. Parity with `app.js` on code nothing runs is not a safety
 * net — it is the decorative-guard shape, arrived at by deletion elsewhere
 * rather than by anyone writing a bad test. The phone's logger is pinned by
 * its own gate (`pnpm run check:parity-mobile`), against the round-major flow
 * it actually runs.
