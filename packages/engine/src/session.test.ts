 * `fillLinkedSets` (authoring-side set propagation) and `duplicateExercise`

 * Their describe blocks went with them. Phase A (18 August 2026) briefly made
 * `Block` a three-member union again with `StrengthBlock` sourced from
 * `@hybrid/strength-engine`; on 21 August 2026 that member MOVED to
 * reflectprotect123-max/strengthside with Task 2 of the repo split, and
 * `Block` is back to `CondBlock | TextBlock`.
 *
 * `duplicateWorkout` survives — it clones a Workout at the block level, not
 * the exercise level, so it never depended on strength shapes for anything
 * but its test fixtures. Those fixtures now build `TextBlock`s instead.
 *
 * `detectPRs` (E3's PR-scan fix) was deleted whole the same day — it derived
 * a PR from logged strength sets, and there is no more strength data to
 * derive one from. Its describe block went with it.
