 * the backup was taken, and tombstones still win — restoring an old file must
 * not resurrect a workout deliberately deleted afterwards.
 *
 * `replace` exists because merge cannot express "this file is the truth, throw
 * away what is here" — the case after a corrupt local store. It is destructive
 * and the caller is responsible for confirming it.
 *
 * Throws on anything that is not an object with at least one of the three
