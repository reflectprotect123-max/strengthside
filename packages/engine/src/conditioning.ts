 * seconds earns nothing AND is not counted as a miss. Most sessions are
 * strapless, so most sessions were invisible to progression — that is the
 * honest answer to "why doesn't conditioning ever move", and this is the fix.
 *
 * The whole duration lands in ONE zone, the one the rated effort names.
 * That is deliberately cruder than a heart-rate trace, which distributes real
 * seconds across three zones, and it is the point: a rating is one number
 * about a whole session, so pretending it resolves minute by minute would be
 * inventing detail the athlete never gave.
 *
 * `zsrc: 'felt'` MARKS IT, and that is the part not to remove. Without it a
 * derived distribution is indistinguishable from a measured one, and every

 * chest strap had recorded it. Measured data always wins: a record that
