17 August 2026. Strength (engine math, coach authoring, mobile logger) was
deleted whole the same day ("fire-sale rebuild," `main` history `540f7f4`
through `f74ef0f`). This is the rebuild, informed by a TrainHeroic
competitive teardown the owner commissioned separately (`75f0b28d-
trainheroicdeepdive.md`) and built to fix its central limitation: a
prescribed set can carry at most two metrics, chosen from a fixed 20-member
enum, and unit variants (`Weight (lb)` vs `Weight (kg)`) are separate enum
members rather than a display concern.

The fix, adopted whole: **metrics are rows in a table, not an enum; a
prescribed set is a set of typed targets, not fixed columns; performance is
an independently-shaped set of measurements, not the same row with values
filled in.** This is the "LEGO" schema the owner approved after an ELI5.
More competitive-analysis material is still arriving from a separate Cowork
session — this spec is written so a later phase can absorb it without
invalidating an earlier one; nothing in Phase A depends on anything UI-shaped.

30 slices, 4 phases, each phase fully usable before the next starts, same
discipline as MacroTrack's Phase 0–5 and the coach redesign's Stage 1–4.
Nothing here touches conditioning or nutrition — CLAUDE.md's one hard
invariant for this rebuild.

---

## Architecture

**New package `@hybrid/strength-engine`.** Pure functions and types, zero
I/O, zero React — the same shape `@hybrid/engine` already keeps for
conditioning (`conditioning.ts`, `autoreg.ts`). It depends only on
`@hybrid/shared-core` for the athlete/exercise identifiers it needs, same
constraint CLAUDE.md already holds `@hybrid/whole-athlete-state` to.

**`packages/engine/src/types.ts`.** `Block<S>`'s union regains its third
member:

```ts
export type Block<S extends AnySet = LoggedSet> =
  StrengthBlock<S> | CondBlock | TextBlock;
```

The "vestigial `S`" comment (added 17 August when strength left) is deleted —
`S` becomes load-bearing again. `StrengthBlock<S>` itself does **not** come
back in its old shape (`exercises: Exercise<S>[]` with `Exercise` holding
`sets: S[]`). Its replacement lives in `@hybrid/strength-engine` and is
described in Slice 3.

**Database.** One new additive migration,
`supabase/migrations/20260818_strength_rebuild.sql`. Nothing existing is
altered — `athlete_weekly_plans`, `publish_coach_week`,
`get_athlete_week_plan` and every table CLAUDE.md already documents as
untouched by the Coordinator/auto-coach deletions stay exactly as they are.

**Timezone.** `assigned_session` (Slice 6) carries the athlete's own
timezone, following the exact pattern `publish_coach_week` already uses per
CLAUDE.md's "Who owns the week" — not reinvented, not coach-clock (the
TrainHeroic doc's Gotcha #1, rejected).

---

## Phase A — Foundation: schema + engine math

Nothing in Phase B/C can be correct if Phase A is wrong, so Phase A ships
complete, with its own full test suite and golden vectors, before any UI
work starts. This mirrors how `@hybrid/engine`'s conditioning half was
built and is verified (`packages/engine/test/golden`).

### Slice 1 — `metric` registry

```sql
CREATE TABLE metric (
  key              text PRIMARY KEY,
  dimension        text NOT NULL,   -- 'mass'|'count'|'ratio'|'time'|'length'|'power'|'velocity'|'energy'
  canonical_unit   text NOT NULL,   -- 'kg'|'rep'|'rpe'|'s'|'m'|'W'|'m/s'|'kcal'
  value_type       text NOT NULL,   -- 'scalar'|'range'|'tuple'|'duration'
  aggregation      text NOT NULL,   -- 'sum'|'mean'|'max'|'min'|'last'|'none'
  higher_is_better boolean,         -- NULL = neither (tempo)
  is_load_bearing  boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false
);
```

Seed rows, exactly: `load, reps, rpe, rir, tempo, rest, distance, duration,
calories, watts, velocity, height`. (`rounds` and `heart_rate` from the
source doc are dropped — `rounds` is conditioning's `condResult` territory
already, `heart_rate` is `@hybrid/engine`'s `hr.ts` territory; neither is a
strength set target and adding them here would duplicate an existing home.)

TS mirror in `@hybrid/strength-engine/src/metric.ts`:

```ts
export type MetricKey =
  | 'load' | 'reps' | 'rpe' | 'rir' | 'tempo' | 'rest'
  | 'distance' | 'duration' | 'calories' | 'watts' | 'height';

export interface Metric {
  key: MetricKey;
  dimension: 'mass' | 'count' | 'ratio' | 'time' | 'length' | 'power' | 'energy';
  canonicalUnit: string;
  valueType: 'scalar' | 'range' | 'tuple' | 'duration';
  aggregation: 'sum' | 'mean' | 'max' | 'min' | 'last' | 'none';
  higherIsBetter: boolean | null;
  isLoadBearing: boolean;
}

export const METRICS: Record<MetricKey, Metric> = { /* generated from the seed, not hand-duplicated */ };
```

`METRICS` is generated by a small Node script
(`scripts/gen-metric-registry.mjs`) that reads the migration's seed `INSERT`
and emits this file, so the SQL seed and the TS map cannot drift — the same
"generate, don't duplicate" discipline this repo already applies to
`CON_FORMATS`. A test (`metric.test.ts`) asserts every `MetricKey` has a
`METRICS` entry and every `METRICS` key round-trips through
`gen-metric-registry.mjs` unchanged when re-run against the current
migration file.

**Edge case**: `tempo`'s `value_type` is `'tuple'` (eccentric/pause/
concentric/pause, e.g. `3010`) — it is stored as 4 digits packed into one
`numeric` in `performed_measurement`/`prescribed_target` (`3010` →
`3*1000+0*100+1*10+0`), decoded by `decodeTempo(n): TempoTuple` /
`encodeTempo(t): number`. Chosen over a 4-column spread because tempo is
always read/written as one unit, never partially — the doc's tuple type
label is honored without adding table width.

### Slice 2 — `exercise` rebuild

```sql
CREATE TABLE equipment (
  id                 uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name               text NOT NULL,        -- 'Barbell (kg)', 'Dumbbell rack', 'Cable stack'
  increment_kg       numeric,               -- 2.5, 1.0 (micro-plates) — NULL if rack/stack
  rack_values_kg     numeric[],             -- declared dumbbell rack, NULL unless rack-typed
  rounding           text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'down'  -- 'down'|'nearest'|'none'
);

CREATE TABLE exercise (
  id                        uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_id                  uuid,             -- NULL = global library, else coach-owned
  name                      text NOT NULL,
  video_asset_id            uuid,             -- first-party storage object, NOT a URL column
  cues                      text,
  equipment_id              uuid REFERENCES equipment(id),
  default_metrics           text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{reps,load}',
  reference_max_exercise_id uuid REFERENCES exercise(id),
  track_as_exercise_id      uuid REFERENCES exercise(id),
  CHECK (id <> reference_max_exercise_id),
  CHECK (id <> track_as_exercise_id)
);
```

**Cycle enforcement is a trigger, not app code** (CLAUDE.md-style "the
database physically refuses," same discipline as the old
`athlete_plan_writer` constraint):

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION check_exercise_edge_depth() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.reference_max_exercise_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM exercise e WHERE e.id = NEW.reference_max_exercise_id
      AND e.reference_max_exercise_id IS NOT NULL
  ) THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'reference_max_exercise_id must point at a root (depth <= 1)'; END IF;
  IF NEW.track_as_exercise_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM exercise e WHERE e.id = NEW.track_as_exercise_id
      AND e.track_as_exercise_id IS NOT NULL
  ) THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'track_as_exercise_id must point at a root (depth <= 1)'; END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER exercise_edge_depth BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON exercise
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION check_exercise_edge_depth();
```

This is the doc's Gotcha #5, applied literally: depth ≤ 1, checked on
write.

**`video_asset_id`, not a YouTube/Vimeo URL** — the doc's rejected item,
explicit here. First-party asset in Supabase Storage, so it's cacheable by
the mobile app's existing offline shell the same way `apps/mobile`'s other
media already is. This is new upload/storage surface and is its own slice
(20) rather than bundled here, because exercise *authoring* (this slice)
must work before video *upload* does.

### Slice 3 — `prescribed_set` + `prescribed_target`

```sql
CREATE TABLE strength_block_item (
  id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  block_id     uuid NOT NULL,      -- FK to the engine's block row once Slice 12 lands
  exercise_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES exercise(id),
  ordinal      int  NOT NULL,      -- position within the block
  grouping_key text,               -- 'A', 'B1', 'B2' — drives A/A1,A2/B1..B4 labelling
  UNIQUE (block_id, ordinal)
);

CREATE TABLE prescribed_set (
  id                uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  block_item_id     uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES strength_block_item(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ordinal           int  NOT NULL,
  is_optional       boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  is_amrap          boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  UNIQUE (block_item_id, ordinal)
);

CREATE TABLE prescribed_target (
  prescribed_set_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES prescribed_set(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  metric_key        text NOT NULL REFERENCES metric(key),
  literal_value      numeric,
  range_lo           numeric,
  range_hi           numeric,
  expr_kind          text,        -- 'pct_of_max'|'lwp_delta'|'pct_of_bodyweight'|'rpe_autoreg'
  expr_arg           numeric,
  expr_ref_exercise  uuid REFERENCES exercise(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (prescribed_set_id, metric_key),
  CHECK (
    (literal_value IS NOT NULL)::int +
    (range_lo IS NOT NULL AND range_hi IS NOT NULL)::int +
    (expr_kind IS NOT NULL)::int = 1
  )
);
```

The `CHECK` is load-bearing: exactly one resolution strategy per target row,
enforced by the database, not by convention — the exact gap that let the
old `Exercise<S>`/`StrengthBlock<S>` shape drift (a `PlannedSet` accidentally
carrying a logged value, per `types.ts`'s own header comment about why that
split needs two test suites). Here it's structurally impossible to author a
target with two strategies.

TS:

```ts
export interface PrescribedTarget {
  metricKey: MetricKey;
  literalValue?: number;
  rangeLo?: number;
  rangeHi?: number;
  exprKind?: 'pct_of_max' | 'lwp_delta' | 'pct_of_bodyweight' | 'rpe_autoreg';
  exprArg?: number;
  exprRefExercise?: string;
}

export interface PrescribedSet {
  id: string;
  ordinal: number;
  isOptional: boolean;
  isAmrap: boolean;
  targets: PrescribedTarget[];   // any combination, any length — the ceiling break
}
```

**No arity limit** is the literal deliverable of this slice: `reps + load +
rpe + tempo + rest` on one set is 5 rows in `prescribed_target`, zero schema
changes.

### Slice 4 — resolution pipeline

```ts
export interface ResolveCtx {
  athleteId: string;
  scheduledDate: string;              // resolve working max AS OF this date (Gotcha #4)
  workingMaxAt(exerciseId: string, asOf: string): number | null;
  lastPerformedLoad(athleteId: string, exerciseId: string): number | null;
  bodyweightAt(athleteId: string, asOf: string): number | null;
}

export function resolveTarget(t: PrescribedTarget, ex: Exercise, ctx: ResolveCtx): ResolvedValue {
  if (t.literalValue != null) return { kind: 'scalar', value: t.literalValue };
  if (t.rangeLo != null) return { kind: 'range', lo: t.rangeLo, hi: t.rangeHi! };
  switch (t.exprKind) {
    case 'pct_of_max': {
      const refId = t.exprRefExercise ?? ex.referenceMaxExerciseId ?? ex.id;
      const max = ctx.workingMaxAt(refId, ctx.scheduledDate);
      if (max == null) return { kind: 'unresolved', reason: 'no_working_max' };
      return { kind: 'scalar', value: roundToIncrement(max * t.exprArg!, ex.equipment) };
    }
    case 'lwp_delta': {
      const last = ctx.lastPerformedLoad(ctx.athleteId, ex.id);
      if (last == null) return { kind: 'unresolved', reason: 'no_history' };
      return { kind: 'scalar', value: roundToIncrement(last + t.exprArg!, ex.equipment) };
    }
    case 'pct_of_bodyweight': {
      const bw = ctx.bodyweightAt(ctx.athleteId, ctx.scheduledDate);
      if (bw == null) return { kind: 'unresolved', reason: 'no_bodyweight' };
      return { kind: 'scalar', value: roundToIncrement(bw * t.exprArg!, ex.equipment) };
    }
    case 'rpe_autoreg':
      return { kind: 'deferred_to_athlete' };  // resolved at LOG time, not publish time — see Slice 6
    default:
      throw new Error(`prescribed_target row with no resolution strategy: ${JSON.stringify(t)}`);
  }
}
```

**`unresolved` is a real return variant, not an exception path.** A coach
programming `pct_of_max` for an exercise the athlete has never tested has no
working max to resolve against — the doc never addresses this case because
TrainHeroic's UI presumably just shows a blank. Here it's typed: the
publish step (Slice 6) refuses to publish a session containing an
`unresolved` target and tells the coach which exercise/athlete pair is
missing a max, rather than silently shipping a `0` or a blank cell to the
athlete's phone.

**`rpe_autoreg` is deliberately NOT resolved at publish time** — it's the
one `expr_kind` that can't be, since it depends on how the *previous* set in
the same session went (an amrap set drives the next set's load via RPE
autoregulation). It resolves inside the mobile logger, live, and is
recorded into `performed_measurement` directly rather than into
`resolved_snapshot`. Test: `resolveTarget` on `rpe_autoreg` never touches
`ctx` and always returns `deferred_to_athlete`, so a future bug can't make
it silently resolve at publish and disagree with the runtime value.

### Slice 5 — rounding engine

```ts
export function roundToIncrement(value: number, equipment: Equipment | null): number {
  if (!equipment) return value;                      // fixed exercise, no rounding
  if (equipment.rackValuesKg?.length) {
    return nearest(value, equipment.rackValuesKg);    // snap to declared dumbbell rack
  }
  if (equipment.incrementKg == null) return value;
  const steps = equipment.rounding === 'nearest'
    ? Math.round(value / equipment.incrementKg)
    : Math.floor(value / equipment.incrementKg);      // 'down' default — never over-prescribe
  return steps * equipment.incrementKg;
}
```

Per doc §2.6: round down by default for percentage work, `nearest` only
where an equipment row explicitly opts in (a coach can set a barbell's
`rounding` to `'nearest'` if they want, default stays `'down'`). The exact
unresolved value (`max * pct`) is preserved on `resolved_snapshot` alongside
the rounded one — `{ display: 228, exact: 228.375 }` — so the mobile long-
press-to-see-exact-value UI (Slice 20) has something real to show, per the
doc's explicit recommendation.

Edge case tested explicitly: `rackValuesKg` with the target below the
lowest rack value or above the highest — clamps to nearest available rather
than extrapolating (a declared 2.5–40kg rack asked for 45kg returns 40, not
42.5).

### Slice 6 — `assigned_session` + publish-time snapshot

```sql
CREATE TABLE assigned_session (
  id                uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  athlete_id        uuid NOT NULL,
  source_session_id uuid,             -- provenance to the authored template/day
  scheduled_date    date NOT NULL,
  state             text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',  -- draft|published|in_progress|completed|skipped
  published_at      timestamptz,
  resolved_snapshot jsonb,            -- NULL until published
  timezone          text NOT NULL     -- athlete tz, per publish_coach_week's existing pattern
);
```

`resolveSessionForPublish(session, exercises, ctx): { snapshot: jsonb } |
{ blocked: UnresolvedTarget[] }` walks every `prescribed_target` in the
session through Slice 4, collects any `unresolved` results, and either
returns the full snapshot or the blocking list — never a partial publish.
This is the direct fix for the doc's Gotcha #4: **a template edit next
month must not rewrite what an athlete was told last month**, because after
publish nothing reads `prescribed_target` for that `assigned_session` again
— only `resolved_snapshot`.

Dedicated test (`assigned-session.test.ts`): publish a session, mutate the
source template's `prescribed_target` rows, re-fetch the already-published
`assigned_session`, assert `resolved_snapshot` is byte-identical to what it
was before the template mutation.

### Slice 7 — `performed_set` + `performed_measurement`

```sql
CREATE TABLE performed_set (
  id                  uuid PRIMARY KEY,        -- CLIENT-GENERATED, not gen_random_uuid() server-side
  assigned_session_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES assigned_session(id),
  exercise_id         uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES exercise(id),   -- may differ from prescription (swap)
  prescribed_set_id   uuid REFERENCES prescribed_set(id),      -- NULL = athlete-added set
  ordinal             int NOT NULL,
  status              text NOT NULL,            -- completed|skipped|not_reached
  performed_at        timestamptz NOT NULL,
  client_created_at   timestamptz NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE performed_measurement (
  performed_set_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES performed_set(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  metric_key       text NOT NULL REFERENCES metric(key),
  value            numeric NOT NULL,   -- always in metric.canonical_unit
  PRIMARY KEY (performed_set_id, metric_key)
);
```

`status` distinguishes `skipped` (athlete saw it, chose not to do it) from
`not_reached` (session ended before this set) — the exact distinction the
doc says TrainHeroic's Compliance report can't make because it has no
published formula. Here `session_compliance`/`block_compliance` (Slice 11)
can be defined precisely because the data supports the distinction.

**Client-generated `id` is the offline-first fix for Gotcha #2** — the
"logged a workout, closed the app, it was gone" bug class. `performed_set`
rows are written to local durable storage (mobile's existing SQLite-backed
store, same mechanism the conditioning logger already uses) the instant a
set is ticked, keyed on the client UUID, and synced via an outbox — never
held in view state until session-finish. This is Slice 27's job to wire;
this slice only needs the schema to support it (client-generated PK, so a
retried sync is a no-op upsert, not a duplicate).

### Slice 8 — e1RM

```ts
export type E1rmFormula = 'epley' | 'brzycki';

export function e1rm(loadKg: number, reps: number, formula: E1rmFormula = 'epley'): number {
  if (reps <= 0) throw new Error('e1rm requires reps > 0');
  if (reps === 1) return loadKg;
  return formula === 'epley'
    ? loadKg * (1 + reps / 30)
    : loadKg * (36 / (37 - reps));   // Brzycki; undefined at reps=37, guarded
}
```

Epley is the account/exercise default (doc's explicit recommendation over
TrainHeroic's hardcoded NSCA chart); `formula` is stored per-exercise on
`exercise` (a new nullable `e1rm_formula` column, Slice 2's table gains it)
and, critically, **on every computed value** — `working_max_event.formula`
(Slice 9) — so a later account-wide default change never silently
retroactively alters a historical value. Brzycki guards `reps < 37`
(asymptote); above that, falls back to Epley with a logged warning rather
than dividing by a negative number.

### Slice 9 — `working_max_event`

```sql
CREATE TABLE working_max_event (
  id           uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  athlete_id   uuid NOT NULL,
  exercise_id  uuid NOT NULL,       -- ROOT exercise, after track_as resolution
  value_kg     numeric NOT NULL,
  source       text NOT NULL,       -- auto_estimate|coach_set|athlete_set|test_result
  formula      text,                -- reproducibility, per Slice 8
  from_set_id  uuid REFERENCES performed_set(id),
  effective_at timestamptz NOT NULL
);
```

Never a mutable column — the doc's explicit rejection of TrainHeroic's
(undocumented, possibly mutable) working-max storage.

```ts
export function currentWorkingMax(events: WorkingMaxEvent[], asOf: string): WorkingMaxEvent | null {
  const upTo = events.filter(e => e.effectiveAt <= asOf).sort((a, b) => b.effectiveAt.localeCompare(a.effectiveAt));
  if (!upTo.length) return null;
  const latest = upTo[0];
  const latestManual = upTo.find(e => e.source !== 'auto_estimate');
  if (latestManual && latestManual.effectiveAt >= latest.effectiveAt) return latestManual;
  return latest;
}
```

Resolves "most recent event, unless the most recent manual event is newer
than any auto event" (doc §2.2's own recommended rule, since TrainHeroic's
real algorithm is undocumented `[U]`). `track_as` resolution happens before
this function is called — the caller resolves `exercise_id` to its root via
`exercise.track_as_exercise_id` first, so `currentWorkingMax` itself never
needs to know about the exercise graph.

**Fixed/unfixed mode**: not a separate boolean column — it's derivable.
"Fixed" is simply "the latest event's `source` is not `auto_estimate`" — an
unfixed max is one whose latest event is still an auto-estimate, so a new
auto-estimate keeps landing; a fixed max's latest event is manual/tested, so
`currentWorkingMax` keeps returning it until another manual/tested event
supersedes it. No extra state to keep in sync.

### Slice 10 — `pr_event`

```sql
CREATE TABLE pr_event (
  athlete_id       uuid NOT NULL,
  exercise_id      uuid NOT NULL,
  rep_count        int  NOT NULL,
  value_kg         numeric NOT NULL,
  achieved_at      timestamptz NOT NULL,
  performed_set_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES performed_set(id),
  PRIMARY KEY (athlete_id, exercise_id, rep_count, achieved_at)
);

export function detectPr(newSet: { exerciseId: string; reps: number; loadKg: number }, priorBest: number | null): boolean {
  return priorBest == null || newSet.loadKg > priorBest;
}
```

Per rep-count, not collapsed (doc §2.5, explicit "Steal, 8/10"). Detection
runs on every `performed_measurement` write where `metric_key IN
('load','reps')` both present on the same `performed_set` — a pure function
called from the sync layer (Slice 23's territory to invoke; this slice only
owns the detector and the table).

### Slice 11 — volume / intensity / compliance

```ts
export interface SessionLoad {
  tonnageKg: number;         // Σ(reps × load) for loaded sets only
  workReps: number;          // Σ(reps) for unloaded sets
  conditioningLoad: number;  // Σ(duration_s × RPE) — sRPE, N/A here but kept as a shape conditioning already fills
}

export function sessionLoad(sets: PerformedSetWithMeasurements[]): SessionLoad { /* three independent sums, never combined */ }

export function intensity(sets: PerformedSetWithMeasurements[], workingMax: number): number | null {
  // Σ(reps × load) / Σ(reps), expressed as % of workingMax — rep-weighted, not a naive mean of set %s
}

export function sessionCompliance(assigned: PrescribedSet[], performed: PerformedSet[]): number {
  const required = assigned.filter(s => !s.isOptional);
  const done = required.filter(s => performed.some(p => p.prescribedSetId === s.id && p.status === 'completed'));
  return required.length ? done.length / required.length : 1;
}

export function blockCompliance(block: StrengthBlockItem, performed: PerformedSet[]): number {
  // every non-optional set in the block has a completed result
}
```

Three separate series, never summed, per the doc's explicit warning
("Never sum across these... a session of 400 calories of Assault Bike
scores zero tonnage" — true here too, tonnage is strength-only by
construction since `is_load_bearing` gates it). `Optional` set flag
(`prescribed_set.is_optional`, Slice 3) is honored exactly as the doc
recommends: excluded from both `session_compliance` and `block_compliance`
numerators and denominators.

Full Phase A test suite: unit tests per function above, plus one
integration test (`strength-pipeline.test.ts`) that runs a synthetic
5×5@75% session end to end — prescribe → resolve → publish → snapshot →
simulate athlete performing it with one deliberate deviation (extra set,
swapped exercise) → detect PR → compute session load — asserting every
intermediate value, the same "golden vector" discipline
`packages/engine/test/golden` already uses for conditioning.

## Phase B — Coach authoring, web

Depends on Phase A only. Builds on the coach bench's existing library
surface (`apps/web/src/coach/library/`) rather than replacing it —
`BlockEditor.tsx`, `DayBuilder.tsx`, and the exercise-wizard pattern already
built this session (Slices EW1–EW7, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-
exercise-wizard-design.md`) are extended, not thrown away.

### Slice 12 — `BlockEditor` strength category

`BLOCK_CATEGORIES` regains `'Strength/Power'` alongside the current
`['Conditioning', 'Mixed modal', 'Warm-up', 'Cooldown', 'Mobility']`.
`BlockValue` regains a discriminated variant:

```ts
export type BlockValue =
  | { category: 'Strength/Power'; id: string; heading?: string; items: StrengthBlockItemValue[] }
  | { category: Exclude<BlockCategory, 'Strength/Power'>; id: string; heading?: string; note?: string; conditioning?: CondValue };
```

New sibling component `StrengthBlockFields.tsx` next to the existing
`CondBlockFields.tsx`, rendering a list of `StrengthBlockItemValue` rows
(exercise + its prescribed sets), each row opening the wizard (Slice 14).
`day-workout.ts`'s `toTextBlock` fallback stops applying to
`'Strength/Power'` — it gets its own `toStrengthBlock`/`fromStrengthBlock`
pair mirroring `toTextBlock`'s existing shape.

### Slice 13 — exercise picker

`ExercisePicker.tsx` rebuilt (deleted 17 August alongside `catalogue.ts`).
Search/filter over `exercise` rows scoped to `owner_id IS NULL OR owner_id =
:coachId` (global library + this coach's own). Picking an exercise surfaces
its `reference_max_exercise_id`/`track_as_exercise_id`/`equipment_id` read-
only (edited from the exercise's own edit screen, not inline here — keeps
the picker a picker). New-exercise creation opens the same create form the
old wizard used, now also asking for `equipment_id` and the two graph edges,
gated by the Slice 2 trigger so a coach can't create a cycle from the UI
either (the trigger fires regardless, but the UI should show a clear error,
not a raw Postgres exception — `createExercise` catches the specific
constraint-violation code and re-throws a typed `CycleError`).

### Slice 14 — set/target builder (wizard extension)

The existing exercise wizard (Exercise → Measure → Sets → Values → Review)
gets its Measure step changed from "pick one metric" to "pick any
combination" — a multi-select chip row (`reps`, `load`, `rpe`, `tempo`,
`rest`, …) instead of a single dropdown. The Values step becomes per-
selected-metric: for `load` specifically, a strategy selector
(`literal | %max | LWP+ | range`) with the matching input; every other
metric defaults to `literal` with a range option. This is a UI-shape change
to an existing step, not a new wizard — per the artifact-design/frontend-
design instinct of extending what's proven rather than forking a second
authoring surface (CLAUDE.md's own warning: "two builders is the state a
prior deletion ended," don't recreate that here for strength specifically).

Review step's summary line changes from "3×5 @ 100kg" to a dynamic
sentence built from whichever targets are present — `formatTargets(targets):
string`, e.g. `"3×5 @ 72.5% (≈163kg) · RPE 8 · tempo 30X1 · rest 90s"` —
tested against every plausible target combination (reps alone, reps+load,
reps+load+rpe+tempo+rest, a range-based rep target) so the summary line
never silently drops a metric the coach actually set.

### Slice 15 — session templates, strength arm

`session-templates.ts` regains strength-bearing templates
(`hybrid-2-intensity`, `hybrid-1-intensity`, `hybrid-roots-1/2`, deleted 17
August), rewritten against the new schema — a template is a
`StrengthBlockItemValue[]` literal, not the old `TemplateExercise`/
`seedExercise()` shape. `lift-and-engine`'s existing Warm-up → Conditioning
→ Cooldown structure regains its Strength section between Warm-up and
Conditioning.

### Slice 16 — `is_test` block flag

`prescribed_set`'s parent `strength_block_item` (or the block itself —
placed on the block per the doc's "Test this block" being block-scoped, not
set-scoped) gains `is_test boolean`. On session completion (Slice 24),
every `performed_set` under an `is_test` block that reports a `load`+`reps`
pair writes a `working_max_event` with `source: 'test_result'` regardless of
whether it beats the prior max — a declared test always updates the max,
even downward, which an ordinary top-set PR-beating write (`source:
'auto_estimate'`) must not do.

### Slice 17 — publish wiring

`DayBuilder`'s publish action calls `resolveSessionForPublish` (Slice 6).
On `{ blocked }`, the coach sees a named list ("Back Squat has no working
max for Alex — set one or change this set to a literal weight") rather than
a generic failure — this is the one place in Phase B that must not silently
degrade, since a blocked publish is better than one that ships a broken
number to an athlete's phone.

---

## Phase C — Mobile logger

Depends on Phase A + a published `assigned_session` from Phase B (or a
seeded fixture for standalone testing). Reuses the existing session-open
flow in `apps/mobile/src/screens/Training.tsx` — strength blocks currently
have nowhere to route (`StrengthRebuilding.tsx` is the entire destination);
this phase gives them a real one, alongside — not replacing —
`Conditioning.tsx`'s existing, untouched routing for conditioning blocks.

### Slice 18 — session state machine screen

New `screens/strength/StrengthSession.tsx`, replacing
`StrengthRebuilding.tsx` as `Training.tsx`'s strength-block destination
(the placeholder is deleted in this slice, not before — CLAUDE.md's
placeholder-screen pattern is explicitly "restore when the real thing is
ready," not "delete on day one"). Renders `assigned_session.state`
transitions: `published` → tap → `in_progress` (writes a local
`started_at`), athlete logs sets, `Finish Session` → `completed`. No new
state machine invented — this is the doc's §1.1 diagram minus `draft` (the
athlete never sees a draft) and minus `moved` (rescheduling isn't in this
rebuild's scope; flagged as an explicit gap, not silently dropped).

### Slice 19 — block list rendering

`grouping_key` (Slice 3, `strength_block_item`) drives label rendering:
single item → `A`, superset pair → `A1`/`A2`, circuit → `B1..B4`. Pure
function `labelFor(items: StrengthBlockItem[]): Record<itemId, string>`,
tested against every grouping shape including a 5-exercise circuit (doc
only shows `C1..C4`; this rebuild doesn't cap circuit size, so the test
includes a 5th to confirm the labeling scheme doesn't break past 4).

### Slice 20 — set logging UI

The core screen. Renders one input row per target actually present on the
`prescribed_set` — not a fixed 2-column layout. A set with only `reps` gets
one field; one with `reps+load+rpe+tempo+rest` gets five, laid out as a
horizontal scroll-safe row on narrow viewports (420px, per CLAUDE.md's
phone-first mobile convention — though this is `apps/mobile`, native, not
`apps/web`'s viewport rule; the equivalent constraint here is "must not
require a horizontal device scroll on a standard phone width," verified in
this slice's own screenshot test). Tap-to-tick when the set matches the
prescription exactly; tap-into-row opens a keypad per metric when it
doesn't (mirrors doc §1.2.5). Completed sets render in the existing
"green" completion styling this repo's conditioning logger already
establishes — reused, not reinvented.

Long-press on a `%max`-resolved value reveals the unrounded exact figure
(Slice 5's `{ display, exact }` pair) inline, per the doc's explicit
recommendation to eliminate "the app told me to load 228.375" support
tickets by always keeping the exact value one gesture away.

### Slice 21 — timers

Rest / Stopwatch / AMRAP / Tabata / EMOM. `packages/engine`'s conditioning
timer logic (already built for `Conditioning.tsx`) is examined first for
reuse — if its interval/countdown primitives are format-agnostic (they
likely are: a Tabata timer doesn't care whether the work is a kettlebell
swing or a row), this slice wraps them rather than reimplementing, and only
adds what's strength-specific: a **Rest** timer keyed to `prescribed_target`
Rest-metric values (auto-started on set completion when a `rest` target is
present), which conditioning's timers have no equivalent trigger for.

### Slice 22 — exercise 3-dot menu

Per set-block-item: comments (free text, coach-visible), lift history
(query `performed_set`/`performed_measurement` for this athlete+exercise,
show last N with dates), working max (`currentWorkingMax`, Slice 9, with its
`ESTIMATED`/fixed label), % calculator (given a typed-in 1RM, show the
%1RM-to-weight table inline — a pure UI wrapper over `roundToIncrement` +
arithmetic, no new engine function needed), swap exercise (Slice 23), move
to end of session (reorders `ordinal` within the session's flat set list,
local-only until sync).

### Slice 23 — swap + deviation support

Swap: opens the exercise picker (a read-only variant of Slice 13's
component, mobile-shelled), writes the new `exercise_id` onto the
`performed_set` the athlete is about to log — the prescription's original
`exercise_id` stays on `prescribed_set`/the snapshot, so provenance is never
lost (this is exactly why `performed_set.exercise_id` is independent per
Slice 7). Add/remove sets at log time: `+`/`−` buttons create/soft-delete
`performed_set` rows with `prescribed_set_id: null` (added) or a
`status: 'skipped'` write (removed) — never a hard delete, matching the
doc's own table (`Set unchecked → soft-delete, not hard delete`).

### Slice 24 — session finish

RPE slider (session-level, distinct from any per-set `rpe` target — reuses
whatever slider component the conditioning logger's session-RPE screen
already has), editable duration (pre-filled from `started_at`→now, athlete-
overridable), free-text comment, `Finish Session` → writes `completed_at`,
transitions `assigned_session.state` to `completed`, and is the trigger
point for Slice 16's `is_test` working-max writes and Slice 10's PR
detection sweep over the session's `performed_set` rows.

### Slice 25 — offline-first writes

Wires Slice 7's client-generated-ID design into the mobile store: every
`performed_set`/`performed_measurement` write goes to local durable storage
(same SQLite-backed mechanism `apps/mobile`'s existing offline shell already
uses for conditioning) **the instant a set is entered**, then queues onto
the existing sync outbox. `Finish Session` is never the first durable
write — it only flips `state`. This is the literal fix for the doc's
Gotcha #2 / TrainHeroic's most-reported App Store bug. Test: kill the app
mid-session (simulated by discarding in-memory state and re-reading only
from local storage) and assert every ticked set before the kill is still
present.

## Phase D — Analytics + closeout

### Slice 26 — PR history screen

Per rep-count list (mobile: athlete's own history tab; coach bench: per-
athlete drawer), reading `pr_event` directly — no computation, this slice
is presentation over Slice 10's data.

### Slice 27 — DOTS score

```ts
// Sex-specific, published coefficients — not TrainHeroic's undocumented StackUp
export function dotsScore(loadKg: number, bodyweightKg: number, sex: 'M' | 'F'): number {
  const coeffs = sex === 'M'
    ? [-307.75076, 24.0900756, -0.1918759221, 0.0007391293, -0.000001093]
    : [-57.96288, 13.6175032, -0.1126655495, 0.0005158568, -0.0000010706];
  const bw = Math.min(Math.max(bodyweightKg, sex === 'M' ? 40 : 40), sex === 'M' ? 210 : 150);
  const denom = coeffs.reduce((acc, c, i) => acc + c * bw ** (i + 1), coeffs[0]);
  return loadKg * (500 / denom);
}
```

Chosen per the doc's explicit recommendation over StackUp (proprietary,
undocumented coefficients): open, peer-reviewed, and — the doc's own point —
documentable as a differentiator against a black box. Coefficient table
gets a comment citing its published source; bodyweight is clamped to the
formula's valid domain rather than extrapolated past it.

### Slice 28 — coach dashboard cards

Volume/Intensity/Compliance cards on the coach bench (`AthleteStatus.tsx`,
which lost its `liftTrends` loop in the 17 August deletion — this slice is
that loop's replacement, not a restoration of the old one, since the
underlying data shape changed entirely). **Each card's definition is shown
in-UI** — a tooltip or subheading stating exactly what's being computed
(`"Compliance = completed required sets ÷ assigned required sets"`) — per
the doc's explicit warning that an undefined metric gets assumed-flattering
by coaches. This is a hard requirement of this slice, not a nice-to-have:
no card ships without its formula visible.

### Slice 29 — e1RM/working-max trend charts

`apps/web/src/coach/data/trends.ts` regains `liftTrendSummary`/
`liftTrends`/`LiftTrendSummary` (deleted 17 August), rebuilt against
`working_max_event` instead of the old mutable `LiftState.kg` field —
a trend line is now a direct query over an append-only event log rather
than a derived reconstruction, which is strictly simpler than what existed
before the deletion.

### Slice 30 — closeout

- `checks/screens.mjs`: `/coach/strength` route's content-match pattern
  reverts from "Strength is being rebuilt" to real pillar content; the
  placeholder screen (`Strength.tsx`) is deleted, matching Slice 18's mobile
  side.
- `checks/docs.mjs`: README's "Two worlds" section reverts to "Three
  worlds," package tree regains `@hybrid/strength-engine`, the 17 August
  deletion paragraph stays (history, not tidied away — this repo's own
  convention) with a new sentence pointing at this spec as the rebuild
  record.
- `pnpm run verify` green, full `checks/` sweep green.
- CLAUDE.md gains a dated section — "Strength is rebuilt" — recording what
  changed from the pre-deletion shape (metric registry instead of fixed
  columns, event-sourced working max instead of mutable, snapshot-at-
  publish instead of resolve-at-read) and why, matching the file's own
  standing convention for every prior deletion/rebuild.

---

## Explicitly rejected (source doc §3.6, applied here)

NSCA lookup chart · `lb`/`kg` as separate metric types · YouTube/Vimeo video
URL field · mutable `working_max` column · coach-timezone publishing ·
undefined Compliance/Intensity/Volume · StackUp's proprietary formula ·
positional prescription (fixed-arity columns).

## Explicitly out of scope for this rebuild

- **Session rescheduling (`moved` state)** — Slice 18 notes the gap
  explicitly rather than silently dropping it; TrainHeroic's `[V]`-verified
  behavior here isn't ported.
- **Parent Calendars / multi-location gyms** — doc rates this a 7/10 steal
  "if you'll serve multi-location gyms"; this app serves one coach's
  roster, so it's skipped, not deferred-and-forgotten — recorded here so a
  future reader knows it was a conscious cut.
- **Prescription templates as a separate first-class object** beyond
  Slice 15's session templates — the doc rates full template management
  7/10; this rebuild folds templates into the existing session-templates
  mechanism rather than building a second one.

## Dependency graph

Phase A has no external dependency and is fully sequential internally
(Slice 6 needs 1–5, Slice 9 needs 8, Slice 11 needs 7). Phase B depends
only on Phase A completing. Phase C depends on Phase A + a way to produce a
published `assigned_session` (either real Phase B or a test fixture — Phase
C's own test suite is not blocked on Phase B shipping first, only on having
*a* publisher, which can be a fixture builder written alongside Phase A's
golden vectors). Phase D depends on both B and C having real data flowing
through them — it is presentation and reporting over Phase A/B/C's output,
last by construction.
