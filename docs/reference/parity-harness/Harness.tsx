/*
 * The parity harness.
 *
 * Reached only through `src/root.web.tsx`, which is only in the module graph
 * when Metro bundles for web. It mounts the app's REAL logger — the same
 * `SessionLogger` the navigator renders — over the session
 * `checks/parity/drive.mjs` seeds into storage, so the two browser-driven
 * parity gates can judge it.
 *
 * What is deliberately absent: the navigator, the tab bar, the safe-area
 * insets and every provider the app wraps itself in. The logger reads none of
 * them — its one seam on the app is `src/screens/logger/bridge.ts`, and the
 * web resolution of that file supplies the session and no-ops the rest.
 *
 * Two things ARE here, and both are here because the visual gate would
 * otherwise be measuring the harness rather than the screen:
 *
 *  - `ThemeProvider`, because the screens read `useTheme()` for every colour
 *    and an unwrapped consumer takes the strength palette from a context
 *    default rather than because anything chose it.
 *  - The same five Inter faces `App.tsx` loads. Without them every glyph falls
 *    back to the browser's serif, and a shot compared against the prototype is
 *    then reporting a missing font on every line of text — which drowns out
 *    any real difference underneath. Nothing renders until they are in, for
 *    the same reason: a screenshot taken mid-load is a screenshot of the
 *    fallback.
 *
 * See `README.md` beside this file for what this proves and what it does not.

   * The prototype asks for `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`; the page
   * Expo generates leaves it at `auto`. Matching it removes one difference
   * between the two pages that has nothing to do with the screen.
   *
   * Measured honestly: on Chromium/Linux this changes NOTHING — the four
   * visual deltas were identical to the digit either side of it, which is how
   * the theory that smoothing explained the residual got ruled out. It is
   * kept because the property is not inert everywhere: a developer running
   * this gate on macOS would otherwise get a different answer from CI for a
   * reason that is not the app.
   *
   * It belongs to the HARNESS and not the app either way — it is a WebKit
   * property, Android has never had it, and nothing about the shipped screen
   * changes.
