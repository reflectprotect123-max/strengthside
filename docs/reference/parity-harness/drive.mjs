/*
 * Drives a target (the prototype today, the rebuilt app later) through the
 * abstract step list from `script.mjs`, using only `[data-parity="…"]`
 * selectors.
 *
 * A hook the script asks for and the page does not have is a real defect
 * in the run, not a thing to swallow: it fails with the hook's name and
 * the step label, e.g. "missing hook `hot-why` at step `log set 3`" — never
 * a bare Playwright timeout.
 *
 * `receipt-<i>` is scoped to the block currently on screen: every block
 * screen sits in the DOM at once (a carousel), so a bare
 * `[data-parity="receipt-0"]` would match the first receipt of EVERY
 * block. Each recorded step in `script.mjs` names which block is active,
 * and receipts are read from within that block's screen only.
 *
 * Phase split — the slice that rebuilds only the logger leaves the old
 * builder in place, so the two halves of the script have to be judged
 * independently:
 *
 *  - `runScript(page, steps, phase)` still WALKS every action in `steps`,
 *    in order, exactly as before — the prototype is one page, and the run
 *    half genuinely depends on the DOM the build half left behind (blocks
 *    exist, a session has started). What `phase` changes is only which
 *    steps get RECORDED into the trace: `'all'` records everything marked
 *    `record: true`, same as before the split existed; `'build'` or
 *    `'run'` records only the `record: true` steps whose own `st.phase`
 *    matches, so a baseline recorded once at `'all'` still has an honest
 *    subset comparable against a phase-scoped run (see
 *    `filterTraceByPhase` below, used by the gates for that comparison).
 *
 *  - `seedAndGoToLogger(page, targetUrl, session)` is the run phase's other
 *    way in: against a real app there is no build UI to replay, so this
 *    writes `checks/fixtures/session.json` straight into the target's
 *    storage (under `LS_KEY`, read from `@hybrid/engine` rather than
 *    hardcoded — see the import below) as that app's one active session,
 *    then navigates straight to the logger route. Only a `--target=<url>`
 *    run reaches this path; `--target=prototype` has nothing to seed,
 *    because the prototype builds its own `session` in-page.
