# ARC layer 3 — built

Status: 8 August 2026. This started as a design-only document — a mapping
pass over the 7 remaining self-coach screens, three independent backend
proposals, a synthesis, and an adversarial design-stage critique, the same
review the layer-2 migration got, applied one stage earlier. **The entire
backend it describes is now built.**

- **§6 (`get_athlete_workout_library`)** —
  `supabase/migrations/20260808_arc_workout_library.sql`. Every finding from
  its critique fixed; the cross-athlete leak (finding 2) and the
  private-template RLS leak (finding 3) proven able to fail by mutation.
  Deny suite: `checks/migrations-apply.mjs`, "ARC — the coach workout
  library".
- **§§1–5 (progression proposals, athlete trends, nutrition review, week
  plan, session detail)** —
  `supabase/migrations/20260808_arc_progression_review.sql`. Every finding
  in §4 fixed; the idempotency domain-scoping fix (finding 2) and the
  nutrition dual-gate fix (finding 6) proven able to fail by mutation. Deny
  suites: `checks/migrations-apply.mjs`, "ARC — progression proposals,
  trends and nutrition review" and "ARC — the read-only week plan and
  session detail". Sign-offs 3–7 were built to their stated defaults; sign-off
  8 was closed by inspection — see the migration's header comment for the
  citation.

**Frontend wiring — COMPLETE as of 13 August 2026.** The four PILLAR screens
(`Readiness`, `Strength`, `Conditioning`, `Nutrition`) joined the four routes
below on that date. They had been gated WITHOUT `layer3Ready` since the
stage-1 coach redesign on 11 August, which meant selecting any athlete other
than the signed-in coach turned the dashboard's four main tiles into
refusals — while the backend they needed (`readiness_trend`, `lift_trend`,
`hard_budget`, `erg_trend`, the nutrition summary/window pair and both
consent grants) was already built and already being pushed by athletes' own
devices. The gap was in the reading, never in the backend.

Two things the closing pass established that are worth keeping:

- The roster view is deliberately SMALLER than the self view, and each screen
  says so on itself. Raw sessions, HR traces, WHOOP dailies and the
  pain/illness safety flags are not in the roster tier, so an absence is
  stated rather than rendered as a zero. "This screen showing no pain flags
  is not the same as this athlete having none" is written on the Readiness
  roster view for that reason.
- `CoachWorkspaceContext.loading` used to be `clients.length === 0 && !error`,
  which cannot distinguish "still asking" from "no athletes". That was
  invisible while nothing branched on the answer; the moment the pillars did,
  it rendered the signed-in coach's own training under a roster athlete's
  name for the first frames after mount. It now tracks the settle explicitly.

**Frontend wiring — done for the four ClientDetailGate routes with a real
backend.** `CoachProgression`, `CoachNutrition`, `WeekReview` and
`CoachAuthoring` each branch on `selectedClient.source`: `engine-local`
renders the original, unchanged self-coach screen; `roster-summary` renders
a NEW, separate roster view built directly against what the backend
actually returns — `AthleteProgressionProposal`, `AthleteNutritionSummary`/
`AthleteNutritionWindow`, `AthleteWeekSummary`, `AthleteWorkoutDraft` in
`apps/web/src/coach/contracts.ts` — never a forced fit into the richer
local types (`ProgressionProposal`, `WeeklyPlan`+`Session`), which would
mean fabricating fields the backend deliberately doesn't carry (free-text
`reason`/`evidence`, block/set detail, a `locked` flag per plan entry).
`ClientDetailGate` gained a `layer3Ready` prop, set on exactly these four
routes; `legacy`/`build`/`planner` stay blocked, because `GuidedBuilder` and
`Planner` still only read and write the signed-in account's own local
`Workout[]` — there is no roster-aware block editor yet, and
`CoachAuthoring`'s roster view says so rather than pretending otherwise.

**The other half of the loop — BACKEND → ATHLETE — is now built too.**
Everything above was coach → backend: a coach acts on web, a row lands in
Supabase. Nothing read it back until `apps/web/src/cloud/arc-athlete-sync.ts`
and `supabase/migrations/20260808_arc_program_assignment_lifecycle.sql`
(the missing `accept_program_assignment`/`decline_program_assignment`
commands — every prior migration could insert a `program_assignments` row
in `'draft'` and nothing could ever move it to `'accepted'` or
`'withdrawn'`). Wired into `SyncProvider`'s existing reconcile cycle
(`apps/web/src/cloud/sync.tsx`), best-effort and silently no-op for the
overwhelming majority of accounts with no coaching relationship at all:

- **Progression** — the athlete's device pushes every pending local
  proposal (`push_progression_proposal`) on each sync, and pulls
  `decision_receipts` for approved ones, REVALIDATES the proposal's
  `before` against the athlete's current local baseline, and only then
  applies it via `applyServerProgression` — refusing rather than
  overwriting when the athlete trained again since the push. A real
  correctness bug was caught and fixed here before it shipped: comparing
  a pushed value against one read back through Postgres jsonb by
  `JSON.stringify` would have called a perfectly fresh value "stale",
  because jsonb does not preserve key order. Fixed with a proper
  structural comparison (`structurallyEqual`), mutation-tested by reverting
  it to `JSON.stringify` and confirming the two regression tests that
  exist for exactly this fail.
- **Trends** — `AthleteStatus.tsx` pushes its already-computed lift/erg/
  hard-budget series (`push_trend_snapshot`) whenever they change.
- **Assignments** — `ArcAssignmentCard.tsx` on the athlete's Home screen
  surfaces any assignment awaiting accept/decline and calls the new
  commands. Accepting records consent, and now — see below — materializes
  the program into the athlete's local training.

**The remaining gap is now closed**: `materializeAcceptedAssignments`
(`apps/web/src/cloud/arc-athlete-sync.ts`), wired into `SyncProvider`'s
reconcile cycle alongside the rest of the BACKEND→ATHLETE loop. On each
sync, every `program_assignments` row in state `'accepted'` for this
athlete that hasn't been materialized yet (tracked in `localStorage`,
`hybrid-arc-materialized-assignments-v1`, so re-accepting or resyncing
never resurrects a workout the athlete deliberately deleted) is turned
into a real local `Workout`: its `program_template_versions.body` is read
directly (RLS already permits it — `can_read_program_template` allows
`template_athlete = auth.uid()`), passed through a defensive shape guard
(`sanitizeAssignedWorkoutBody` — the body is coach-written, unconstrained
jsonb, same trust posture as `athlete_domain_snapshots`), and given a
stable id (`arc:<assignmentId>`) and `days` from `preferred_weekdays`
(already 0=Sunday on both sides of this boundary — see the `CoachAuthoring`
weekday-encoding fix this same session caught and corrected). No date is
ever written — placement still goes through the *existing, unmodified*
`proposalsFromDB` → `buildWeeklyPlanFromProposals` → Coordinator pipeline,
exactly like a self-authored recurring workout; the Coordinator never
learns a session came from a coach. Colocated tests:
`arc-athlete-sync.test.ts`, `sanitizeAssignedWorkoutBody` — the
kind-allowlist guard mutation-tested (reverting it to a bare cast makes the
"drops an unrecognised kind" test fail, confirmed then restored).

**The roster block/set editor is now built too.** `Planner`
(`apps/web/src/screens/Planner.tsx`) was refactored to accept an optional
external `workout`/`onEdit`/`onBack` — everything below that (every block,
exercise and set control) already only ever called one `edit(fn)` closure,
so this is a ~15-line change, not a fork. `RosterPlanner.tsx`
(`/coach/roster-plan/:workoutId`, gated `layer3Ready`) supplies that
closure against a roster client's draft: local edits apply instantly for a
responsive UI, and a `SaveCoalescer` (`coach/save-coalescer.ts`) debounces
the actual `saveWorkoutDraft` network write, guaranteeing at most one save
in flight at a time — required because `save_workout_draft`'s optimistic
concurrency is a single `base_version` compare-and-swap, and two concurrent
writes from the same tab would race on it even with nothing else touching
the draft. An edit that arrives mid-save is never dropped — the coalescer
marks itself dirty and re-fires with the latest value the instant the
in-flight save resolves. `RosterAuthoringView` gained an "Edit blocks"
button per draft. Colocated test: `save-coalescer.test.ts`, both the
coalescing and the never-two-in-flight property mutation-tested.

Context: `docs/ARC_CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/HANDOFF_2026-08-08_ARC_IMPORT.md`,
`docs/RISK_REGISTER.md`, `apps/web/src/coach/ClientDetailGate.tsx`. Layers 1–2
(`supabase/migrations/20260808_arc_coach_workspace.sql`) are built, tested,
and had their own security review — see `RISK_REGISTER.md` and the commit
`e89d51c` — before this document existed.

## 1. The mechanism decision that unblocks everything else

**Progression approval never lets a backend RPC write `liftProgress` /
`conProgress`.** `@hybrid/strength-engine` and `@hybrid/conditioning-engine`
own that math and it stays client-side, per CLAUDE.md.

The athlete's device pushes an immutable copy of a proposal it already
computed (`push_progression_proposal`, SECURITY DEFINER, `auth.uid() =
athlete_user_id` checked in the body — **not** a bare RLS `INSERT` policy,
see finding 1 below). The coach calls `decide_progression_proposal(org,
athlete, proposal_id, decision, idempotency_key)`, which follows
`create_program_assignment`'s exact shape: `coaches_athlete()` first, then
one transaction writing `coach_decisions` + `decision_receipts` only. On its
next sync the athlete's device reads its own receipt, revalidates the
proposal's stored `before` value against its current local baseline, and
only then calls the existing, unmodified `applyApprovedProposal()`. A
mismatch (the athlete retrained since the push) refuses rather than
overwriting.

## 2. New tables — four, everything else reuses layer 1–2

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `progression_proposal_snapshots` | Immutable, device-pushed proposal copy for coach review. |
| `athlete_trend_snapshots` | Pre-reduced trend arrays (top-K e1RM, one erg series, hard-count/budget) — engine math stays client-side; this is the already-computed output only. |
| `nutrition_read_grants` | Athlete-controlled, revocable consent gating the raw nutrition detail tier. |
| `coach_read_audit` | Athlete-visible log of privileged *reads* (nutrition window, session detail) — separate from `coach_decisions` because a read is not a decision. |

Reused unchanged: `athlete_domain_snapshots`, `athlete_weekly_plans`,
`coach_decisions`, `decision_receipts`, `program_templates`(+versions),
`program_assignments`, `assignment_input_versions`,
`create_program_assignment`.

## 3. Per-screen build plan

- **CoachProgression** — new: the two tables/RPCs above.
- **CoachAuthoring** — `program_templates`/`create_program_assignment`
  already covers "assign a program." The live-tuning mode (editing a
  client's own workout library) has no proposed backend — default is
  retirement for roster clients (sign-off 1).
- **CoachNutrition** — two tiers: a summary RPC (adherence %, trend
  direction, estimate confidence — no raw values, gated by `coaches_athlete`
  alone, extending the counts-only precedent) and a raw-window RPC gated by
  `nutrition_read_grants` **and** a live `coaches_athlete()` check (see
  finding 6 — the first draft omitted the AND).
- **WeekReview** — new `get_athlete_week_plan`: entries/decisions/session
  summaries, no block/set detail. Per-session detail is read-only in v1
  (sign-off 5); an edit path is not built.
- **AthleteStatus** — new `athlete_trend_snapshots` + a read RPC, gated by
  `coaches_athlete` alone (same tier as counts).
- **DecisionTrace / ExceptionHistory** — **out of scope.** Both re-resolve
  ephemeral local device state in real time; there is nothing persisted to
  serve remotely. `ClientDetailGate` keeps blocking these for roster clients.
- **OnboardingPanel** — **out of scope**, self-coach-only. Stays
  `engine-local`.

## 4. Design-stage critique — fix these when the migration is actually written

Six findings, same review posture as the layer-2 security pass, applied to
the design before any SQL exists:

1. **HIGH — "no INSERT policy" contradicted.** The synthesis's own per-table
   notes describe `progression_proposal_snapshots` and
   `athlete_trend_snapshots` as athlete-writable by a bare `auth.uid() =
   athlete_user_id` RLS policy — exactly the direct-client-write shape layer
   1–2 forbids everywhere else, and nothing stops an athlete device from
   setting `organization_id` to an org it isn't enrolled in as `'athlete'`.
   Both must be `push_*` SECURITY DEFINER functions with an
   `is_org_member(org, array['athlete'])` check, not policies.
2. **HIGH — idempotency key omits `domain`.** Stated key:
   `(organization_id, athlete_user_id, subject, source_at)`. In
   `progression.ts`, `source_at` is session-level (shared by every move in a
   session) and `subject` is a free-text display string — a strength and a
   conditioning proposal from the same athlete can share both and collide.
   The identical bug class the `coach_decisions` idempotency comment already
   documents. Add `domain` (and the real progression `key`, not the display
   `subject`) to the uniqueness scope.
3. **HIGH — the "client-minted uuid" doesn't match what the code mints.**
   Real local ids are deterministic strings like
   `` `strength:${session.id}:${move.key}:${at}` ``, not UUIDs, and not
   proven globally unique across athletes. Either the server mints `id` via
   `gen_random_uuid()` on push and returns it for the device to store, or the
   match is on the natural key from finding 2 — not a `uuid` column expecting
   the device's own string.
4. **MEDIUM-HIGH — `decide_progression_proposal` doesn't validate
   `proposal_id` against the snapshot.** As specified it writes the decision
   and receipt without joining `progression_proposal_snapshots` to confirm
   the id belongs to `(org, athlete)` or to source the real `subject`/
   `before`/`after` for the receipt. A coach-supplied id and summary text
   would go unchecked against what the athlete's engine actually produced.
   Must `select … where id = p_proposal_id and organization_id = … and
   athlete_user_id = …`, erroring if not found, and build the receipt from
   that row.
5. **MEDIUM-HIGH — no `hard`/`direction` column.** The design promises the
   constraint `reason` string is stripped to a boolean at push time, but the
   column list has nowhere to put it. Without a real `hard boolean not null`
   column, the coach cannot be told a proposal is a pain/illness-blocked
   `review` case at all — the same failure shape (a safety signal silently
   not reaching the reviewer) as the snapshot-crash finding in the layer-2
   review, this time by omission rather than crash.
6. **MEDIUM — nutrition raw-window gate may not be AND'ed with
   `coaches_athlete()`.** If `nutrition_read_grants.granted_to` is null
   (org-wide, open per sign-off 2) or a grant outlives a later-revoked
   assignment, a same-org coach who does not coach this athlete could still
   read raw macros/weight. Require both checks together, the same
   belt-and-braces the layer-2 review added to `coaches_athlete()` itself.

Holds up, per the critique: engine-math ownership stays client-side and
unmodified; nothing here lets nutrition data reach the Coordinator or feeds
`whole-athlete-state` a target instead of a fact. Also flagged as needed but
not yet specified: `get_athlete_week_plan` and the trend RPC will need the
same defensive jsonb-shape guards `get_athlete_training_summary` needed for
`athlete_domain_snapshots`/`athlete_weekly_plans` — both are unconstrained,
client-written JSON.

## 5. Sign-offs

Numbered for reference. 1 and 2 are decided (8 August 2026); the rest are
defaults stated explicitly so silence is not mistaken for approval.

1. **DECIDED — CoachAuthoring live-tuning mode gets a real backend.**
   Not retired. `get_athlete_workout_library` is designed and reviewed —
   see §6. One critique finding (a cross-athlete content leak through the
   unmodified `create_program_assignment`) must change the plan, not just
   the SQL, before this is built.
2. **DECIDED — nutrition consent is per-coach, immediate revocation.**
   `nutrition_read_grants.granted_to` is `not null` — a specific coach id,
   never org-wide. The raw-window RPC checks `revoked_at is null` as a live
   read on every call (not a cached/synced flag), so there is no window
   after revocation where a removed coach still reads raw macros or weight;
   the very next call simply fails the grant check. Default grant duration:
   none stated by the user — until explicitly revoked, matching how
   `coach_athlete_assignments.status` itself has no expiry today.
3. **Progression sanitization** — is `hard: boolean` sufficient in place of
   `constraint.reason` (default: yes, matches `has_safety_flag`), or does
   coaching need a coarser reason category as a middle ground?
4. **SessionDrawer scope** — read-only in v1 (default above), or build
   `propose_session_edit` too, and if so how the athlete-device diff-apply
   is verified against drift?
5. **Trend snapshot cadence** — push-on-open only (default; the view may be
   briefly stale) vs. a new push trigger?
6. **Read-receipt UX** — is a nutrition-window/session-detail read surfaced
   live to the athlete via `coach_read_audit`, and can they revoke access
   mid-session?
7. **Retention/expiry** — for `progression_proposal_snapshots` and
   `athlete_trend_snapshots`: kept forever like `coach_decisions` (default),
   or pruned once superseded/applied?
8. **`explanation`/`reasonCode` string audit** — not a decision, a task:
   confirm today's decision-explanation templates don't already interpolate
   raw `constraint.reason` before `get_athlete_week_plan` ships, since that
   would leak the same detail sign-off 3 is deciding to withhold.

## 6. `get_athlete_workout_library` — BUILT (resolves sign-off 1)

Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260808_arc_workout_library.sql`. Deny
suite: `checks/migrations-apply.mjs`, "ARC — the coach workout library".
Every finding below is fixed in the shipped SQL, not deferred; findings 2
and 3 additionally have a mutation-proven test — the deny check was
confirmed to fail when the fix is reverted, the same standard applied to
every other check in this migration set.

Same process as §§1–4: two independent proposals, a synthesis, an
adversarial critique. The critique found a genuinely serious hole the
synthesis's own prose had papered over — recorded here so it cannot be
missed when this becomes SQL.

**The central question, resolved.** A published draft becomes a real
`program_assignment`, through the *existing, unmodified*
`create_program_assignment` — not a second, parallel intent channel.
Publishing: (1) snapshots the draft into an immutable
`program_template_versions` row, (2) calls `create_program_assignment`
against that version, in the same transaction. The assignment lands in its
existing `draft → ready-for-coordinator → accepted` state machine; the
Coordinator places it exactly like any templated program. The coach never
writes a session or a date.

**New table**, `coach_workout_drafts` — the mutable head a coach live-tunes
before publishing: `id, organization_id, athlete_id, coach_id` (last
editor), `workout_id` (client-minted, matches the real `Workout.id` used in
`EngineDB.workouts`), `template_id` (FK `program_templates`, nullable,
created lazily on first save), `kind`, `body jsonb` (the real `Workout`
shape — `name`, `blocks`, `days`, `dates`, `folderIds` — opaque to Postgres,
no progression math in SQL), `base_version`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`.
`program_templates` gains a nullable `athlete_user_id` for a private,
single-athlete template.

**RPCs**, same SECURITY DEFINER + `coaches_athlete()`-first + one-transaction
shape as everything else: `get_athlete_workout_library` (read),
`save_workout_draft` (optimistic concurrency on `base_version`, conflict on
mismatch, never silent overwrite), `publish_workout_draft` (snapshots,
assigns, all in one transaction).

**Conflict handling** — one mechanism: `base_version` optimistic concurrency
for coach-vs-coach; for coach-vs-athlete, there is no shared row to race on,
since a draft only ever reaches the athlete's device via an explicit
`accepted` assignment.

### Critique — fix these before this becomes SQL

1. **The proposed `program_templates.athlete_user_id` CHECK constraint is
   invalid SQL.** It puts a subquery inside a `CHECK`, which Postgres
   forbids — the existing migration already hit and documented this exact
   mistake for `preferred_weekdays` (`<@` was the fix there). Enforce the
   athlete/org pairing in `save_workout_draft`'s body, not in a constraint.
2. **CRITICAL — a cross-athlete content leak through the unmodified
   `create_program_assignment`.** That RPC only checks
   `coaches_athlete(org, p_athlete_user_id)`; it never checks that
   `template_version_id` belongs to that athlete or to no athlete. A coach
   who coaches both athlete A and athlete B can take a
   `template_version_id` snapshotted from B's *private* draft and call the
   existing RPC with `p_athlete_user_id = A`, assigning B's private workout
   content to A. The synthesis's claim that "the RPC layer forbids this" is
   prose only — no such check exists, and the design insists
   `create_program_assignment` stay unmodified. **This is the one finding
   that must change the plan, not just the SQL**: either add an ownership
   check inside `create_program_assignment` itself (a real modification of
   the already-audited function), or forbid private-athlete templates from
   ever reaching the generic assignment path at all and only assign them
   through `publish_workout_draft`'s own gated snapshot-and-assign call.
3. **Private templates leak through every existing template-listing
   surface.** `program_templates` RLS today is org-scoped
   (`is_org_member`), built for shared reference material. Adding
   `athlete_user_id` without touching RLS means any coach in the org sees
   every athlete's private drafts through whatever already lists templates
   by organisation. RLS must exclude `athlete_user_id is not null and not
   coaches_athlete(organization_id, athlete_user_id)`, and every existing
   template-listing query needs auditing against this new row shape.
4. **`coach_decisions.kind` doesn't have the value this needs, and the
   design contradicts itself on audit volume.** The existing enum has no
   `workout_draft_saved`; `save_workout_draft` as specified would fail on
   insert. Separately, §"Immutability/audit" says drafts are unaudited
   "no row-per-keystroke," while the RPC section has `save_workout_draft`
   writing a decision row on every save — a row-per-keystroke audit trail,
   contradicting the stated intent. Resolve to: no decision row on save,
   only on publish.
5. **No uniqueness on `workout_id` scoped to (org, athlete).** Two
   concurrent first-saves for the same `workout_id` can each pass a
   check-then-insert race and produce two `program_templates` rows for one
   client-side `Workout.id`. Needs `unique (organization_id, athlete_id,
   workout_id)` and an `insert ... on conflict` lazy-create, not
   check-then-insert.
6. **Unspecified: `Workout.dates` (one-off dates) has no mapping to
   `program_assignments.preferred_start_date`/`preferred_weekdays`.**
   `Workout` supports arbitrary one-off dates as an alternative to a
   recurring weekday set; `program_assignments` only models the latter.
   `publish_workout_draft` needs an explicit rule — reject a dates-based
   workout, or a real mapping — not silent dropping.

Holds up: the Coordinator-placement principle itself, once finding 2 is
fixed — publish never writes a date, only calls the existing intent RPC.
Idempotency scoping matches the audited pattern. `Workout` carries no
safety-flag-shaped field, so the layer-2 snapshot-crash class doesn't recur
here as-is.
