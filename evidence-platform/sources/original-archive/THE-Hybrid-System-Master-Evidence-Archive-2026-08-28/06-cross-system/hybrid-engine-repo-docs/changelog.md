# Changelog

## The React apps ship: site cut over, APK built, everything debugged — 27 July 2026

The migration stopped being a parallel universe. The React apps are now the
live site, and the Android app compiled for the first time and installs as an
update over the shipped one — same key, same icon, versionCode 28.

**The cutover.** Netlify had been publishing the old vanilla app all along; the
React apps existed only in the repo. `scripts/build-site.mjs` now assembles the
one directory Netlify serves — athlete app at `/`, coach at `/coach/`, icons,
fonts, assetlinks, privacy, `_headers`/`_redirects` — and fails the build if
anything the built HTML references is missing. A tombstone at the old
service-worker path hands existing installs over cleanly. Hashed bundles are
immutable-cached (they were being re-downloaded in full on every launch);
the workers and the shell stay no-store. `checks/deploy-smoke.mjs` serves the
publish directory with Netlify's own precedence rules and boots both apps
under the real CSP, because every failure mode of this topology is silent.

**The debug pass, all four surfaces.** Six engine divergences from the vanilla
spec — two of them changed what the app told you to lift: warm-up seconds were
being dropped from the conditioning denominator so progression levels were
handed out unearned, and "10-8" read its floor as 8 so a missed set scored as
a make and the load went up. Seven coach bugs, led by publish dates computed
in UTC (every coach east of Greenwich assigned work to yesterday) and a loader
that blanked whole prescriptions read back off disk. On web, five ways the app
lost work — a live conditioning run died if you glanced at another tab, and
the conditioning clock froze at 0:00 for anyone whose strap notifies faster
than once a second. The same interval bug existed on mobile. A failed save now
shows a banner above every screen instead of only inside Settings.

**Mobile actually builds now.** It never had: a variable import Metro rejects,
a resolver setting wrong for pnpm, an undeclared NativeWind runtime, and an
`import.meta` Hermes refuses at parse time — all invisible to typecheck, which
stayed green throughout. Then prebuild surfaced two more: the app had no icon
file at all, and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` was missing from the manifest, so the
rest alarm — the reason a native app exists — could never have fired on
Android 13+. CI now runs the real bundler on every push. Fourteen more mobile
fixes landed alongside (instant-firing rest alarms, BLE that never asked for
permissions, untypeable Settings fields, a keyboard that ate the first tap on
Finish Set), plus the parity gaps: Start buttons on Home, the resume card,
plate breakdown in the logger, backup export, and the coach-link card.

**WHOOP works from the phone.** The functions identified a connection by a
browser cookie the app can never hold, so mobile connections succeeded
server-side and stayed invisible forever. Identity is now the Supabase access
token, verified in full — issuer, audience, role, subject — because the public
anon key is itself a valid JWT signed with the same secret, and a
signature-only check would have let anyone impersonate anyone.
`checks/supabase-auth.mjs` attacks the verifier with eleven forgeries,
including that anon key, on every CI run. Web keeps its cookie flow untouched.

**The importer is gone.** Owner's call: it never worked well enough to earn
its keep. ~2,500 lines out across the engine parser, both screens, OCR,
dictation, and three native dependencies. Imported workouts are untouched —
they were always just workouts.

**Both apps got their design back.** The coach app went from a narrow column
with a sign-in form in the header to the shell it was designed for: rail, week
board with real day previews, wide editor with a prescription table — built
from the six coach cards that had sat unused in `design/cards/`. Three
behaviours got honest too: deleting the last exercise arms a "Delete session?"
confirm instead of silently discarding the day, looking at a week no longer
creates it (creation is an explicit "+ New week"), and the rail numeral opens
a jump-to-week list. The athlete Home got back everything the port lost — the
week strip, the neon readiness ring, lit zone bars, one big brass CTA — and
the "Elsewhere" pill row is dead, its routes reachable through doors that mean
something.

**Numbers, because a changelog should have them.** 23 commits. Engine 69,
coach 14, react-smoke 23, deploy-smoke 13 and supabase-auth 11 all green;
1,262 golden vectors byte-identical; 22 pentest attacks held; Metro bundles
1,413 modules; and one APK on a QR code.

## The coach site is the Planner, and publishing stops losing things — 26 July 2026

The coach builder is rebuilt in the app's own language: one top bar, one column
of the phone's cards opening in place, in the same dark/brass system the
athlete uses. What you author on the laptop now looks like what gets run on the
phone — because it is the same card.

**Authoring**
- **Reps and RPE are typed, per set.** A ladder is just different numbers —
  `12 / 10 / 8 / 8` — and the summary line reads exactly as the phone renders
  it. Rest steps in ±15s. Block headings are editable in place.
- **`W` marks a warm-up.** Type `W` or `W10` and the set becomes a warm-up: the
  row recedes, and on the phone it is skipped by the weight autoregulation, by
  volume and average-RPE, and by PR detection. A warm-up at RPE 4 used to tell
  the engine to add weight; a heavy warm-up single could register as a PR.
- **Supersets are built by chaining two cards**, using the phone's own rules —
  so a coach can't author a shape the logger runs differently.
- **Conditioning is a block**, authored as format + Easy/Medium/Hard.

**Publishing — what used to be silently dropped**
Rest was hardcoded to 90 seconds. Tempo was always empty. A "Conditioning"
section published as an ordinary strength block, so the heart-rate engine never
engaged. Coach instructions and exercise cues were authored, stored, and then
thrown away at the boundary. All of it travels now, and there's a test that
publishes a session and reads it back through the athlete's own code to prove
it.

**Prescribed load** has no field in the phone's set model — RPE prescribes
effort and the athlete's history picks the kilos. A coach who wants to name a
number writes it in the exercise note, which the athlete now reads on the card.
Old libraries migrate automatically: sessions become blocks, columns become
per-set targets, and any weights already typed are folded into that note rather
than lost.

## Debug pass: eleven real bugs, three of them data loss — 26 July 2026

A full audit across sync, resilience, refactor correctness, dead code and
mobile layout. What it found and what changed:

**Data loss**
- **A conditioning run could be deleted by cloud sync.** The merge score
  counted only completed *sets*, so a session whose work was a run scored zero,
  lost the merge to the server's copy, and had its whole HR record erased on the
  next sync. Conditioning results now count as work, and every write onto a
  session stamps it.
- **A felt-RPE rating was dropped by every sync**, both for session-embedded
  and standalone records — the latter because records were unioned by id
  first-past-the-post with the server as the base. They are now merged per
  record.
- **Storage-full failures went silent after the first one.** The warning
  latched once and the only other signal was hidden on every phone, so the
  logger kept drawing ticks for sets that would vanish on reload. It now warns
  again and always toasts.

**Correctness**
- **Tapping the Training tab started a session — of the wrong workout.**
  Viewing the tab created one from the first saved workout rather than today's,
  and marking that phantom complete left a second, hollow record for the same
  day. Only starting a workout creates a session now.
- **`1e309` in the weight box poisoned the record permanently** — stored, copied
  to the next set, then rendered as `Infinity` in the recap, exercise history
  and Progress (which threw real SVG errors). Non-finite input is refused on the
  way in, and every computed weight is clamped.
- **Easy/Medium/Hard was scored against a point, not the band it showed you.**
  Rating a run 7 against "Medium · RPE 5-7" read as *"ran harder than medium"*
  and told Readiness to pull back. Anything inside the band is now on target.
- **The plan editor's letter chip did nothing** (and told screen readers it
  collapsed the card), the Logger showed **two identical "next exercise"
  buttons**, and that footer button could point at the exercise you were already
  on — discarding a rating you had just dialled in.
- An absurd `rest` value could strand the timer at `Infinity:NaN` across
  reloads. Rest is clamped to an hour.

**Mobile**
- **You could not raise a custom rep range on a small phone.** The `+` buttons
  rendered 13.6px wide and the second was clipped off-screen entirely; they are
  44×48 and fully visible now.
- **The back button collapsed to a 19px sliver** with a long session name — the
  one control that gets you out of a live logging screen. It no longer shrinks.
- **The floating rest chip sat on top of the weight input**, so a tap meant to
  edit the weight killed the rest timer. It is suppressed while the stage shows
  its own rest panel.
- A long unbroken name no longer scrolls the page sideways.

Also: the coach digest now carries conditioning effort/target/felt, and the
Progress tip stopped pointing at the Builder, which was removed months ago.

## The plan editor is full screen too — 26 July 2026

The Logger and the plan editor are meant to be one surface in two modes, so
they now behave identically. Tapping an exercise in a plan opens **its own
screen** — back arrow, block and session name, the controls, ‹ Back to plan —
exactly the shell the Logger uses, instead of an accordion squeezed between the
rows. Same for a conditioning block.

Nothing about the controls changed: sets stepper, rep chips, the RPE slider,
±15s rest, track mode, ↑↓✕. They just get the room to breathe, and the plan
list stays a clean list of rows.

## The Logger is full screen — 26 July 2026

Logging used to happen in an accordion wedged between the rows above and below
it, so the controls you tap mid-set were the smallest targets on the page and
`rest 3:00` and the target chip got clipped on a real phone. Tapping an
exercise now opens its own screen: back arrow, the session's name and block,
the progress bar, and then the set — set dots, `SET 1 OF 4`, target, weight and
reps, Finish Set. Nothing else competing for the space.

The guided flow itself is unchanged — same one-set-at-a-time stage, same RPE
slider, same autoregulation, same in-place rest clock. It just gets the whole
viewport. The footer carries **‹ Back to session** and the next exercise, so
you can move through a workout without going back to the list at all, and the
Training tab stays lit throughout because the stage is a detail view of the
session, not a fifth tab. The weight box also shows a `kg` placeholder when
there's no history to prefill, instead of sitting there empty.

## A sample session, one tap away — 26 July 2026

Trying the Logger no longer starts with importing something. **Load a sample
session** sits under Import in the Library (and as *Or load a sample* on the
Home zero-state card): one tap saves a full demo workout, schedules it for
today, and drops you on Home ready to start it.

It's built to exercise everything the Logger does — a timed warm-up and a
plain rep count, straight kg × reps at RPE 8 (the weight-autoregulation path),
a rep range, a superset pair that flows A→B and rests after the pair, a 45s
hold, a max-reps set, and a Medium conditioning block to finish. Nothing about
it is special-cased: it's an ordinary saved session, so you can edit it in the
Planner, reschedule it or delete it like any other, and tapping the button
again just re-uses the one you already have instead of piling up copies.

## One effort word: Easy · Medium · Hard — 26 July 2026

Conditioning is authored in the same language as everything else you lift. A
plan used to ask you to think in two unrelated scales — RPE for sets, a
heart-rate band for runs — so the conditioning block's **Target zone** picker
is now an **Effort** picker: Easy, Medium, Hard, each chip carrying the RPE it
means (RPE 3-4 · 5-7 · 8-9.5) in its zone's colour.

- **One word, both vocabularies.** Picking *Hard* stores the effort and the
  Overload zone together, so the live engine, saved results and older plans all
  keep working untouched. Blocks authored before this read back through the
  same door — a saved *Recovery* block is simply *Easy*.
- **It tells you what it means.** The card spells it out at today's numbers:
  "Hard = hold Overload (165-187 bpm today), about RPE 8-9.5 — a few words at a
  time." The anchors are the talk test; the bpm still move with your recovery,
  so the word stays put while the target adapts.
- **You rate it on the same slider.** Finishing a conditioning session now asks
  *How hard was that?* on the exact 1-10 slider you rate sets with, against the
  effort you asked for. The target-vs-felt gap feeds **Readiness** exactly like
  a lifting session's does — a run that cost far more than it should now counts
  as evidence.

## Conditioning joins the Planner — 25 July 2026

Sessions can finally carry conditioning again — authored in the same plan
editor. **♥ Conditioning** (next to ＋ Block) drops an HR block into the
session: pick a format (Steady-state · Intervals · Tempo · Custom · Free run)
and a target zone (Recovery / Conditioning / Overload, shown in their zone
colours). The card previews the prescription **at your earned level** — the
plan never freezes a number, so the engine still progresses it as you adapt
and eases it on a low-recovery day. In the workout it runs exactly as before:
tap the row, train by live heart rate, and the result lands back in the
session, History and Progress.

## Planner structure: shape the session, not just the numbers — 25 July 2026

The plan editor now changes the session's shape too, still in the Logger's
visual language:

- **Chain link between exercises.** One tap on the link between two rows makes
  them a superset ("flows on" — A→B with no rest, rest after the pair, exactly
  how the Logger runs it). Tap a lit link to split them apart. Linking across
  two sections merges them into one pair.
- **＋ Exercise / ＋ Block** — a new exercise opens straight into the movement
  search (same sheet as the mid-session swap), pre-set to 3 sets @ 1:30 rest.
- **↑ ↓ ✕ on the open card** move an exercise (hopping section boundaries at
  the edges) or remove it. Emptied sections clean themselves up.
- **Tap a section heading** to rename it — type anything, or one-tap
  Warm-up / Main / Accessory.

## The Planner: build it like you'll run it — 25 July 2026

Saved sessions are editable again — not with the old dense Builder, but with
the Logger's own surface. Library → ⋮ → **Edit** opens the session as the
exact list you'll see mid-workout (same rows, same summaries), and tapping an
exercise opens it with the Logger's controls flipped from read to write:

- **Sets** are the set-progress dots with − / + around them.
- **Target reps** are one-tap chips (3-5 · 5 · 6-8 · 8-10 · 8-12 · 12-15 ·
  max), with a custom low/high stepper for oddballs. Imported per-set ladders
  show as "mixed" until you deliberately override them.
- **Target effort** is the same 1–10 RPE slider you rate sets with — what you
  set here is what the weight autoregulation centers on. A "no target" chip
  hands it back to the 8.5 default.
- **Rest** steps in ±15s — the same vocabulary as the live rest timer.
- **Track** picks kg × reps / reps / seconds. No weight field anywhere:
  history and RPE own the weight.
- Renaming an exercise uses the same search sheet as the mid-session swap.
- Everything autosaves as you tap — no Save button, no draft state.
- Coach-assigned plans stay as sent: Edit on those becomes "Duplicate & edit."
- A session already in progress keeps the previous plan; changes apply next
  time.
- Set verdicts are now judged against the set's own target RPE ("right on
  target" means *your* target, not always 8.5). A felt 10 always reads max
  effort.

## Two import fixes that feed the guided Logger — 25 July 2026

- **Imports without rest now default to 1:30** instead of 0. Zero rest made
  the new guided flow silently skip its rest stage; 90s is a floor you can
  stretch live with the +15s button. The draft preview says
  "rest 1:30 (default)" so nothing is hidden. Completion-style items
  (mobility checklists) still get no rest.
- **The Home "start here" card now opens the importer directly** — its copy
  always promised that; it used to detour through the Add sheet.

## Guided set flow: the Logger coaches every set — 25 July 2026

The open exercise is no longer a table of rows — it's a stage that walks you
through one set at a time, and the weight now moves itself between sets.

- **Finish Set → RPE slider → Confirm Set.** Big weight (±2.5 kg stepper) and
  reps inputs, then a full 1–10 RPE slider (0.5 steps) — no more typing RPE
  into a tiny box.
- **The weight autoregulates after every confirmed set.** Each RPE point away
  from the 8.5 target moves the next set's weight by 2.5% of the current
  weight, rounded to 2.5 kg plates (rates from the Tuchscherer/Helms
  RPE-to-%1RM chart; below RPE 6 is linear extrapolation — no published chart
  data exists there). Missing the rep floor counts as worse than true failure.
  A set with its own target RPE (e.g. "@7") autoregulates around that instead.
- **The verdict is spelled out** after every set — "That set was easy —
  +2.5 kg for Set 3 (100 kg)." — and the new weight is already filled in.
- **Last time, per set.** Each set shows what you did on the same set last
  session ("100 kg × 8 @ RPE 7.5"), not one summary line for the exercise.
- **Rest runs in the stage** with a countdown, progress bar, **+15s** and
  **Skip Rest** — and auto-advances to the next set when it hits zero. The
  floating chip still mirrors it everywhere else in the app.
- **Set dots** across the top of the card show done / current / remaining.
- **Supersets pair properly:** A → B with no rest inside the pair, rest after
  the pair, then back to A for the next round — set by set, not
  exercise by exercise.
- When an exercise is finished, the card offers **"Next: …"** to jump
  straight to the next unfinished lift.

## Remove the manual Builder; import is now the only way in — 27 July 2026

The block-by-block session Builder is gone. Every session now starts the same
way: paste it, photograph it, or say it, and the importer turns it into a
saved session in your Library.

- **"Create Session" is gone** from the Add sheet — the only option now is
  Add From Library. **Library's create card is now "Import a session"**
  instead of a blank template builder.
- **Saving an import goes straight to your Library** with a confirmation
  toast, instead of dropping you into an editor to review it block by block.
- **A saved session can no longer be edited in place.** Duplicate it and
  re-import the changed version, or delete and start over — the "Edit
  session" option is gone from a session's menu.
- **Every icon that used to be an emoji is now a matching stroke-drawn glyph**
  — Home, the Calendar sheet, Library's menus, and the importer's mic/camera
  buttons all switched together, so nothing looks mismatched.
- Both empty-state screens (a fresh Library, a fresh Training tab) point at
  Import/Library instead of a Builder that no longer exists.

This was requested and built alongside a Claude Design visual pass (see the
entry below) — the export had already made these decisions and this ships
them into the real app, ported onto everything shipped since that export was
taken (this session's bug fixes, the trend cards, and the design pass itself).

## Design pass from Claude Design: restrained type, flatter brass — 27 July 2026

Imported a visual polish pass built in Claude Design (exported as a zip, since
this environment can't complete the interactive `/design-login` handshake the
live sync needs). CSS only — no structure changed:

- Display type pulled down in weight with tighter tracking; numbers everywhere
  (stats, HR, e1RM, RPE) get consistent tabular-figure treatment.
- Micro-labels (kickers, section heads) quieter and wider instead of shouting
  in gold.
- Cards, stats and sheets get one soft top-down light source instead of
  layered gradients.
- Brass buttons/FAB matte instead of glossy — one highlight hairline, no amber
  bloom.
- The zone/ring neon glow is toned down a step (still legible, less candy).
- Empty states get more breathing room.

**One thing caught and fixed before this shipped:** the exported HTML had
silently dropped the `#s-builder` screen container and the `#exNames`
autocomplete datalist — invisible until populated by JS, so the design tool's
export pruned them as "unused" markup. Both are read directly by `app.js`
(`renderBuilder()`, `refreshExNames()`); either missing would have crashed the
Builder screen outright. Neither was applied — verified by screenshotting the
Builder open with an exercise added, no console errors, before shipping.

Also present in the export but **not applied**: an icon-system pass in
`app.js` swapping emoji glyphs for a matching set of stroke SVGs. Real design
work, but out of scope for this pass (index.html only) — a candidate for a
follow-up.

## Two trend cards: getting fitter, recovering over time — 27 July 2026

- **Top Lifts now shows an 8-week delta.** Each of your top 5 lifts compares its
  best estimated 1RM over the last 8 weeks against the 8 weeks before that —
  `+5kg vs 8 weeks ago`, `no change`, or a drop. A lift you haven't tested heavy
  in the last 16 weeks just shows nothing, rather than a made-up number.
- **WHOOP recovery is now a real trend, not a fortnight of noise.** The chart
  used to show only the last 14 days, which mostly just shows how much your
  recovery bounces night to night. It now shows your full history (up to ~4
  months) with a 7-day rolling-average line laid over the daily one, so you can
  actually see whether it's trending up or down. The rolling line only appears
  once you've got at least 14 days of data — before that it's just the raw
  daily line, same as today.

Both reuse numbers the app already trusts — no new tracking, no new science.

## Training model: correctness pass — 27 July 2026

A full audit of the conditioning engine found that a number of its numbers were
invented rather than derived, and that several behaved differently from what the
app said they did. This release fixes what was outright wrong and removes what
could not be justified. No new model yet — that comes next.

**Fixed — these were affecting your training:**

- **Low-recovery days now ease the session for everyone.** The deload was gated
  on having already earned a progression level, so a brand-new athlete on 25%
  recovery got the full prescription. The least-adapted athlete was getting the
  least protection.
- **High-recovery days no longer claim an adjustment they never made.** That
  branch changed a label and nothing else. There's no evidence base for scaling a
  session up on a good day, so the app no longer pretends there is.
- **Progression is judged on your working time, not the whole session.** The
  on-target test divided by total session length — warm-up, every rest and the
  cool-down included. Since base intervals are only about a fifth actual work,
  passing it required your heart rate to stay high *through the rests*, which is
  close to the opposite of adapting.
- **One stray heartbeat can no longer re-zone you.** A single spurious reading
  used to raise your stored max HR permanently, shifting every zone boundary. It
  now takes corroboration across several beats, committed at the end of a session.
- **HR recovery is honest about what it measured.** It used to hunt backwards
  from the 60-second mark for any usable reading and label whatever it found
  "60s" — sometimes measuring a 2-second window. It now reports the window it
  actually used, and shows nothing when there isn't a clean one. Because it was
  unreliable, it no longer influences progression; it's recorded and displayed.
- **A finished session keeps its own verdict.** Progression read whatever WHOOP
  said at that moment, so a late sync could change the outcome of a workout you'd
  already completed. Sessions now store the recovery, resting HR and zone method
  they were actually run with.
- **Sessions longer than about 90 minutes keep their whole heart-rate trace.**
  Everything past that point was being folded into a single final data point.
- **A planned session shows the same length every day.** Its duration was being
  recalculated through today's recovery, so a plan you wrote last week appeared
  to change on its own.
- **Two devices can no longer both lose track of an eased week**, and past
  sessions are redrawn against the zones they were actually scored with rather
  than a fixed set they may never have used.
- **Your coach can tell a demo run from a real one again.**

**Removed:**

- **The weekly zone-minute targets (60 / 45 / 12).** Those numbers were invented,
  nothing ever set them, and every athlete was measured against the same three
  constants. They were also wrong on their own terms — that split puts almost
  twice as much moderate work in the week as the polarized-training evidence
  supports. The card now simply reports the minutes you banked in each zone.
- **The estimated calorie figure.** It was a published equation with its
  bodyweight, age and sex terms deleted and replaced with fixed numbers, and
  there's no bodyweight anywhere in the app to put back. It was being shown to
  you and sent to your coach.

**Still provisional:** the daily zone-shift percentages have a defensible
*direction* but no published basis for their size. They're now labelled as
guesses in the code rather than presented as fact.

## Coach ↔ athlete: connect another person — 26 July 2026

You can now coach someone else — they keep their own account, their own app and
their own WHOOP, and you get visibility into their training.

- **Invite from the coach site.** Athletes → Invite athlete generates a one-time
  code. They paste it into **Settings → Coach** in their app and the link goes live.
- **Their training appears in Athletes**: sessions logged, conditioning and runs
  (duration, avg/max HR, time in zone), and a 14-day WHOOP recovery strip, with
  7-day totals up top. Read-only — a coach can look, never edit.
- **What's shared is deliberately narrow.** Their app publishes a bounded digest
  (last 90 days, no raw HR traces) to a dedicated table. A coach never gets access
  to the athlete's own private state — notes, settings, gym setup and the learned
  lexicon all stay theirs. The athlete's Settings screen spells this out before
  they connect.
- **The athlete is in control.** Disconnect at any time from Settings → Coach; the
  coach's access is derived from the live link, so it dies instantly and the
  published digest is deleted.

## Neon rings & zone bars + step counting — 26 July 2026

- **Brighter rings.** The WHOOP recovery/strain arcs now glow properly — a tight
  core plus a wide bloom over a darkened track, so they read as lit rather than
  just coloured.
- **Bolder heart-rate zone bars.** Taller bars in true neon, each with its own
  glow. The muted band inks are still used everywhere a zone is *read as data*
  (charts, live gauge); the neon variants are only for the lit strips and dots.
- **Steps today.** Shown on the WHOOP line and in Settings. Counted by your
  phone's own pedometer — WHOOP's API carries no step data, so this is the free,
  on-device source. Needs the new app version and a one-time "allow physical
  activity" permission. Browser-only installs simply don't show it.

## Full debug pass (six-agent review) — 26 July 2026

A deep multi-agent review of both apps. Fixes for the real issues it surfaced:

- **Sync safety.** A session finished with the checkmark now records an edit time, so
  a rare two-device delete-vs-complete race can't drop a completed workout. Legacy
  coach sessions can no longer linger in your cloud state, and a coach session you
  delete stays deleted (it won't get re-pulled on the next sync).
- **Long-press fixes.** Reschedule ("Move") now truly moves a recurring session instead
  of quietly leaving it on both days. Fixed a case where, on some phones, the tap right
  after a long-press could be swallowed.
- **Coach site hardening.** A dirty-edit guard so a background refresh can't overwrite
  work you haven't saved; a malformed cloud library can no longer white-screen the
  editor; supersets now survive the trip to the phone; and double-tapping Publish can't
  create duplicate calendar entries.
- **Security.** Tightened the coach database rules (row-level security) so the coach↔athlete
  link and program/assignment writes can't be forged by other accounts — see the one-time
  SQL patch in the schema file.

## Long-press a session → Move / Delete — 26 July 2026

- **Press and hold** any session card (Home or Library) to bring up a quick menu:
  **Move** (reschedule to another day with a date picker), **Delete** (remove it),
  or **Cancel**. A normal tap still starts the session — only a ~half-second hold
  opens the menu, and a light haptic buzz confirms it.
- Deleting a **coach-assigned** session also clears the underlying assignment, so it
  doesn't reappear on the next sync; moving one reschedules the assignment too.

## Coach website foundation + phone hooks — 26 July 2026

The first real slice of the coach website (Entity 2) plus the phone-side plumbing
so a coach-authored session can land on your calendar. No visible change to the
phone app on its own — the hooks stay inert until you connect the coach site.

- **Coach website (`/coach`).** A real, deployable local-first coach builder in the
  TrainHeroic session-editor style: programs → weeks → days → sessions, prescription
  tables with per-column measure types, supersets (chain-link A1/A2), Session Preview,
  and Supabase sign-in that syncs your library to the cloud. Works fully offline.
- **Emit contract.** A single, tested boundary (`coach/js/emit.js`) that converts coach
  sessions to the phone's exact format and can never write a logged-result field into a
  target — guarded by a dual-mode contract test against the real `sanitizeDB`.
- **Assign to phone.** From the coach editor, publish a session to a date on your
  calendar (self-coached: same account both ends).
- **Phone consume.** The app now reconciles coach assignments on sync/foreground and
  materializes them as calendar sessions, without ever clobbering in-progress logging
  or pushing coach templates back up as your own data.
- Groundwork: additive Supabase schema (coach_library, assignments, token-gated links),
  service-worker `/coach` bypass, separate-site deploy config.

## Gym-floor kit + Settings in the bottom bar — 25 July 2026

Small tools for the training floor, plus a nav tidy-up.

- **Settings moved to the bottom bar** as a fourth tab (Home · Training · Library ·
  Settings), so it's one tap from anywhere — the Home gear is gone.
- **Plate calculator.** Tap the weight on any lift → a sheet shows what to load
  per side of the bar ("92.5kg → 25 + 10 + 1.25") with a plate visual. Set your
  bar weight and which plates you own in **Settings → Gym setup**; if a weight
  isn't loadable it shows the nearest you can make.
- **Per-set notes.** Jot a line on any set — "belt on", "left knee tweak",
  "paused" — from the logger; it shows back up in that day's History.
- **Swap an exercise mid-session.** Rack taken or feeling a niggle? Swap the
  movement from the logger and keep your sets and targets; it remembers what it
  was swapped from.

All additive, on-device, and merged safely across devices; all six test suites
green (four new tests). SW v60, versionCode 17 / 2.9.3.

## Sync hardening — two devices never lose each other's work — 25 July 2026

Cloud sync used to replace your whole workout/session list with whichever device
synced last, so scheduling something on your phone and your laptop between syncs
could quietly drop one side's days. Now it **merges record-by-record**:

- **Workouts and sessions merge by id** instead of last-write-wins. Scheduled days
  are unioned (you never lose a planned session), edits take the newer side, and
  logged history is always kept.
- **Deletions stick.** Deleting a session records a tombstone so a merge from an
  older device can't resurrect it.
- **The push side merges too**, so a save can't clobber a change another device
  made since you last pulled.
- **Settings → Cloud** now shows a live status line — last synced, how many devices
  are on your account, and a **Sync now** button.
- **Restore** asks for confirmation and tells you what's in the backup first; the
  device registry and WHOOP samples stay device-local and never churn the sync.

No data model or feature change; all six test suites green, including a new
two-device merge + tombstone test.

## Matte Instrument — a visual upgrade across every screen — 25 July 2026

A design pass that lifts the whole app without changing how anything works — same
screens, same data, more premium.

- **Real depth.** The surfaces were too close in tone, so cards sat flat. The
  panel ladder is widened and the page ground dropped a notch, so cards actually
  float; inputs are recessed wells; the open logger card lifts with a warm gold
  key-light and a gold top-edge, and the other exercises quietly recede behind it.
- **Gold owns the brand again.** "Done" states used to borrow the conditioning
  green; they're now warm brass — so green means only heart-rate zones, and gold
  carries the identity.
- **Sharper type.** One locked exercise-name size (no more resize when a card
  opens), tabular figures on every live KG/reps/RPE number so columns don't
  jitter, and a proper hairline rule under the SET · TARGET · KG · REPS · RPE
  header.
- **Finish.** A consistent corner-radius scale so shapes rhyme, brushed-brass
  badges and buttons, and a gentle accordion reveal when a set table opens
  (respecting reduced-motion).

All six test suites stay green; no behaviour, data, or feature changed.

## The Library Release — three tabs, a real Library, Home you can read at a glance — 25 July 2026

The app reorganised around how you actually use it: a home you glance at, a place
you train, and one shelf that holds everything else.

**Three tabs: Home · Training · Library.** The bottom bar is down to three. Builder,
Conditioning and Progress all moved under a new **Library** — each on its own tab
(Sessions · Conditioning · Progress), styled like the athlete app: a LIBRARY title,
a search box, a "Create Session Template" card, and a row per saved session with its
exercise summary, an **Add** button and a ⋮ menu (edit · duplicate · delete).

**Home shows today.** Your saved sessions live in the Library now, not scattered on
the front page — Home shows only what's actually on for today, plus a new **Today's
heart-rate zones** card (the conditioning front page, surfaced) sitting right by your
WHOOP rings. Those rings are now **bright neon** — a glowing cyan strain ring around a
neon recovery ring — so recovery reads in a glance.

**A + button that schedules.** Tap **+** on Home to add a session to today or any day
ahead: **Create Session** (pick Strength or Conditioning, then build it as you go) or
**Add From Library** (drop a saved session onto the chosen day). Sessions can be
scheduled for a specific date, not just a recurring weekday.

**Gone: the demo template.** The app no longer seeds a blank six-block placeholder —
you start clean and add exactly what you want. Any leftover copy of the old seed is
cleared automatically.

## The Athlete Release — new Logger, recap, PRs, custom conditioning — 24 July 2026

The phone app rebuilt around one loop: show today's work, log it fast, adapt to
your recovery, prove your progress. Four phases in one release:

**The Logger (the blessed design, live).** The session view IS the logger now:
every exercise a collapsed row — letter chips (A, B; supersets share a letter as
C1/C2/C3), live state, rx summary — and tapping one opens its per-set table in
place: SET · TARGET (your prescription, ghosted) · KG · REPS · RPE · ✓. Ticking
a set autofills blanks from last time, starts the rest ring, and supersets flow
to the next movement automatically. One card open at a time; the whole day
readable at a glance.

**The app remembers.** Finish a session and a recap screen marks the moment:
volume, sets done, planned-vs-felt RPE verdict, HR zones if the day was hybrid —
and any records you set. New per-exercise history: best set, estimated-1RM
(Epley) trend chart, every past session; reachable from the recap, History day
rows, the logger's "history ›" link, and a new Top lifts card on Progress.

**Conditioning depth.** A Custom format (your rounds / work / rest, editable on
the setup screen) and a Free run mode (open-ended — just track HR, finish when
done). Both record zones and HR recovery like everything else; the earned
progression stays reserved for the three canonical formats.

**Reliability + readiness.** The rest-timer buzz now fires from a native alarm
even when the screen is off (WebView timers throttle — the phone itself keeps
time now). The session header shows your recovery and what it means today
("green light — push the top sets" / "take −1 RPE today and win anyway"), and
Home gains the one dominant tap: Start today's session / Resume.

Native shell **v2.8.0 (versionCode 13)**. Service-worker cache v54. All six
suites green, logger tests rewritten to the new behaviors.


## Always-visible Settings — 23 July 2026

Fixed a real gap: **Settings** (cloud sync, WHOOP, profile, export/import backup)
was only reachable through the WHOOP chip on Home — which only appears once WHOOP
is connected and synced. If you weren't on WHOOP, there was no way to open Settings
at all. Added a permanent **gear button in the Home header** that opens Settings
regardless of WHOOP state.

Native shell **v2.7.1 (versionCode 12)**. Service-worker cache v53.


## Weekly zone targets, live zone-time, transitions & a proper rest ring — 23 July 2026

Four bigger UI/UX builds:

- **Weekly zone targets (Morpheus banking).** Home and Progress now show three
  rings — Recovery / Conditioning / Overload — filling toward a weekly
  target-minutes goal (60 / 45 / 12 by default), banked from your sessions. Turns
  the trend charts into something to hit.
- **Live "time in zone" + streak.** During a conditioning session the live screen
  shows a colour bar of the minutes you've banked in each zone so far, and a
  "🔥 in zone" flame appears while you're holding your target zone.
- **Screen transitions.** Navigating now fades-and-lifts each screen in (respects
  reduced-motion) so the app feels less like hard page swaps.
- **Rest timer, redesigned.** The rest chip is now a circular countdown ring around
  the clock — glanceable from across the gym — and it survives a reload with the
  ring intact.
- **Logger orientation.** A session-progress bar ("3 of 7 done · 43%") sits under
  the header so you always know how far through the workout you are.

Native shell **v2.7.0 (versionCode 11)**. Service-worker cache v52. All six suites
green, plus a new regression test for the weekly zone-target maths.


## Visual polish pass — 23 July 2026

Small, high-value UI/UX touch-ups after the debug sweep:

- **Home "Last recovery"** now shows your actual recovery %, colour-coded
  (green / amber / red), instead of a blank dash when a WHOOP score is available.
- **Live conditioning gauge** — the big BPM number now stacks cleanly over "BPM"
  and the current zone name, and the zone name is painted in its own zone colour
  (blue / green / red) instead of wrapping awkwardly.
- **Phase bar** reads the format name during warm-up instead of a meaningless
  "Round 0 / N".
- **Progress → Conditioning** leads with an "Interval progression" card showing the
  level you've earned per format and the target it now serves (e.g. Intervals ·
  Lv 3 · 9×35s / 85s) — the autoregulation made visible in your trends.

Native shell **v2.6.2 (versionCode 10)**. Service-worker cache v51. All six suites green.


## Debug pass: crash fixes + a real cloud-sync data-loss fix — 23 July 2026

A full debug sweep (static review across three subsystems + a runtime driver that
exercises every flow and edge case). Findings, all fixed:

- **Cloud sync silently dropped settings — data loss.** The sync fingerprint only
  hashed workouts and sessions, so anything stored under settings — your
  **progression levels, standalone conditioning history, and HR profile
  (resting/observed max)** — never reached the cloud, and could be **overwritten by
  a stale second device** on reconcile. Now settings are part of the fingerprint
  (minus the device-local WHOOP daily cache), and a new merge keeps additive data
  safe on both push and pull: progression never regresses (max level per format),
  conditioning history and the learned import lexicon are unioned, never clobbered.
- **Conditioning blocks could crash the app.** A conditioning block has no
  exercises; several core functions (Home volume/RPE stats, readiness card,
  Builder name list, session auto-create, "last time" lookup, preview) iterated
  exercises without guarding, so a hybrid workout coming from cloud/import/in-session
  could blank a screen. All guarded. The root cause — the data sanitizer injecting a
  phantom blank exercise into every conditioning block on load — is fixed too.
- **Cloud pull and backup import now sanitize** incoming data (a second device or a
  hand-edited backup can't install malformed blocks).
- **Storage-full is no longer silent** — a full device now surfaces a clear "not
  saved" warning instead of pretending the save worked.
- **Result mis-filing hardened** — a conditioning result now finds its block by id
  (survives reordering), and an explicit tested max HR is authoritative (no silent
  auto-raise over a number you entered).

- Native shell **v2.6.1 (versionCode 9)**. Service-worker cache v50.

Verified: all six suites green, plus new regression tests for the settings-sync
fingerprint, the additive merge, and the no-phantom-exercise sanitizer; and a
runtime driver that pushes 14 flows/edge-cases with zero console errors.


## Intervals that progress themselves — the Morpheus autoregulation model — 23 July 2026

Your interval sessions now get harder as *you* get fitter — and back off when you
don't — instead of staying frozen at 8×30/90 forever. This is how Morpheus does
it: not a fixed ladder, but **autoregulation** from the metrics we already record.

Two coupled loops:
- **An earned baseline.** After every real session, the app reads that session's
  metrics — time held in the Conditioning/Overload zones, your 60-second HR
  recovery versus your recent median, whether it was sustainable — and steps a
  hidden per-format **level** up when your body shows it adapted. Miss the mark
  twice and it eases back so you keep progressing rather than stalling. When it
  climbs, it rotates the levers for balanced overload: **add a round → lengthen
  work → trim rest**, each capped.
- **A daily readiness gate.** Today's actual prescription is your earned baseline
  *scaled by your WHOOP recovery*, on the same 80/40 bands the zones use. A red
  day deloads **today only** (a round off, or longer rest) without touching your
  hard-earned level; a green day serves the full thing.

Nothing changes silently: the conditioning screen shows today's exact
prescription and why (`9×35s / 85s · Level 3 · strong recovery`), the results
screen tells you when you stepped up and what's next, and the Builder block
previews what it'll serve. Demo runs never move your baseline, and a level-0
profile is byte-for-byte the old session — so nothing you've done changes until
you earn it.

- Native shell **v2.6 (versionCode 8)**. Service-worker cache v49.

Verified: all six suites green — the smoke test asserts level-0 equals the base
session, that a strong on-target session steps the level up, and that a
red-recovery day deloads today without changing the earned baseline.


## The hybrid session + Morpheus-grade heart-rate zones — 23 July 2026

Strength and conditioning stop being two separate apps. One workout can now
interleave set-by-set lifting with live heart-rate conditioning pieces — the
Morpheus "mixed" model — and the whole zone engine was rebuilt to match how
Morpheus actually trains.

**Heart-rate zones — the best-evidence formula.**
- **Max HR** now uses **Tanaka (208 − 0.7 × age)**, the meta-analysis-validated
  formula that beats 220 − age (which overestimates for the young and
  underestimates past ~40), and **auto-raises** to any higher beat you hit in a
  session — exactly what Morpheus does.
- **Zones compute on Heart-Rate Reserve** (Karvonen: `resting + pct × (max −
  resting)`) whenever your resting HR is known — from Settings or straight from
  WHOOP — the gold-standard, fitness-individualised method. It falls back to
  %max cleanly with no band.
- Three bands are now **Recovery / Conditioning / Overload = blue / green / red**
  (Morpheus's palette; colour-blind-checked), and they **re-zone every day with
  your WHOOP recovery, asymmetrically**: a low-recovery day broadens blue and
  drops the overload line so "hard" arrives sooner; a high-recovery day expands
  green and lifts overload so you can safely push.
- Settings shows the method in use, a resting-HR input, and today's bpm ranges.

**One hybrid workout.**
- Builder gains **♥ Add conditioning** — a block with a format (steady /
  intervals / tempo) and a target zone, no exercises.
- The session runs strength rows and a live heart-rate conditioning row in one
  place; finishing the conditioning piece writes its result onto the block and
  returns you to the workout. Standalone conditioning (the Conditioning tab) is
  unchanged.
- History and Progress show conditioning from both hybrid sessions and
  standalone runs. Existing workouts and saved data are untouched (blocks
  default to strength).
- Native shell **v2.5 (versionCode 7)**. Service-worker cache v48.

Verified: all six suites green (browser-smoke now builds and runs a full
strength-plus-conditioning session, and asserts the Tanaka value, the HRR/%max
method switch, and the blue/green/red bands).


## Importer gains voice: just say your workout — 23 July 2026

Third way into the importer, alongside type/paste and photo: **speak it.**

- **Say it** button → dictation streams into the box live, then runs the
  same parser + review + learning. Speak an exercise at a time (natural
  pauses = clean lines).
- **Speech is tidied for the parser:** number words → digits ("four by
  eight" → 4x8), "at RPE eight" → @RPE8, "three minutes" → 3min, "thirty
  seconds" → 30s, "into/then" → new lines, "a hundred kg" → 100kg. Run-on
  sentences are split before each "<number> <movement>".
- **Two engines, one behaviour:** the installed app uses Android's
  on-device SpeechRecognizer via a new native bridge (free, offline,
  auto-restarts for continuous dictation); Chrome uses the Web Speech
  API; unsupported browsers say so. Mic permission handled natively.
- Native shell **v2.3 (versionCode 5)** adds the voice bridge +
  RECORD_AUDIO. Service-worker cache v47.

Honest scope: voice is a fast *capture* — brilliant one-exercise-at-a-time,
and the review screen catches anything a run-on mangles. Verified: all six
suites green (browser-smoke now also asserts prose-as-notes and the voice
tidy pipeline).


## One coherent app: dashboard Home, conditioning everywhere, polish — 23 July 2026

The full UX pass (Tier A–C from the audit):

- **Home is a dashboard now.** Below your plan: quick actions (Start
  conditioning · Import a workout) and glanceable stats (kg this week,
  day streak, last recovery) once you have data. The seed card reads
  "Session template" instead of "Untitled workout". Dead space gone.
- **Conditioning feeds Progress:** a new Conditioning section with
  stacked zone-minutes-by-week bars (Low/Moderate/High), an HR-recovery
  trend, and an average-HR trend. Demo sessions are excluded.
- **Conditioning shows in History:** finished sessions appear on their
  day next to strength work — duration, avg/max HR, HR recovery — and
  tap through to the full results view.
- **One visual language for the body:** recovery bands now share the
  zone palette (green/gold/red) and the strain ring uses the same blue
  as the Low zone — no more neon one-offs.
- **Recovery-driven zones (Morpheus-style):** strong recovery (≥67%)
  nudges work thresholds up 2%, poor recovery (<34%) eases them 4% —
  labelled on the setup screen so it's never silent.
- **Live-session niceties:** a 5s "Get ready" countdown before every
  session, audio cues on phase changes (high beep = work, low = recover)
  alongside the vibration, and a Skip › button to jump an interval.
- **Warmer empty states:** History's quiet days get a proper card;
  Settings' WHOOP errors read like English, not HTTP.
- **Accessibility:** visible gold focus rings on everything interactive,
  aria-labels on back buttons, dim-text contrast raised.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v44. All six suites green (browser-smoke
  32 steps, unchanged assertions all still pass).


## Importer: write it or photograph it — it becomes a template — 23 July 2026

Builder gains "Import from text or photo". Type or paste a workout in any
style — or attach a screenshot/photo — and it becomes a real, editable
template. Free and fully on-device.

- **Meaning-only questions.** It never nags about blank weights or reps
  (those fill at logging time, as always). Only genuine ambiguity — an
  unknown movement, "power primer 3x3" (exercise or section?), a probable
  typo like "test 45s" — appears as an amber chip INSIDE the draft, fixed
  in place. Clean input builds instantly with zero questions.
- **It learns your shorthand.** Every confirmed fix becomes a rule in
  your lexicon (synced with your account): your abbreviations, spellings
  and movements. Two-tier on purpose: vocabulary is learned forever;
  "that section contained X this time" is never generalised. The lexicon
  is visible and editable (tap ✕ to unlearn).
- **Photo/screenshot OCR, on-device.** Self-hosted tesseract.js (WASM)
  reads the image locally — first use downloads ~7 MB, then it's cached.
  The photo never leaves the device; screenshots of typed text read
  near-perfectly (a synthetic screenshot round-trips to a saved template
  in under 2 seconds in tests). Works in the installed Android app, in
  Chrome, and in the Windows app alike.
- **Base library of ~110 movements** with aliases (DL/RDL/OHP/KB/T2B…),
  plus notation for sets×reps, ranges (8-10), per-set lists (8,8,6,6),
  EMOM/AMRAP, "into"/"then 3 rounds" circuits, A1/A2 supersets, timed
  holds, carries, each-side and @RPE.
- Saving opens the template straight in the Builder for a final look.
- Native shell v2.1 (versionCode 3): the in-app file chooser now honors
  the page's accept types, so photo picking works for the importer while
  backup import still filters to JSON.
- CSP: script-src gains 'wasm-unsafe-eval' (WebAssembly only — inline
  script remains blocked; pentest suite unchanged and green).
- Service-worker cache bumped to v43. The OCR engine is deliberately NOT
  in the offline app shell — it loads on demand and browser-caches.

Verified: all six suites pass (browser-smoke 32 steps, incl. a full
importer round-trip with learning assertions), plus a real-OCR
end-to-end: screenshot → text → draft → saved template, no errors.


## Native Android app v2: live heart rate INSIDE the installed app — 22 July 2026

The installed Android app can now do live WHOOP heart rate — no Chrome
needed. The old TWA wrapper could never expose Bluetooth, so it has been
replaced by a small native shell (plain Java, zero dependencies) with a
BLE bridge.

- **window.AndroidHR bridge:** native scan → connect to WHOOP's HR
  Broadcast (BLE heart-rate service) → second-by-second BPM streamed into
  the Conditioning screen. Auto-connects when it sees a WHOOP; shows a
  chooser if several straps are broadcasting; auto-reconnects on dropouts.
- **Runtime permissions handled natively** (Bluetooth on Android 12+,
  location-scoped scan on 7–11), including the "turn Bluetooth on" prompt.
- **Same package, same signing key, versionCode 2** — installing the new
  APK over the old app is a normal in-place update; nothing is lost.
- Native niceties the WebView needed: backup **export** via the system
  file saver, backup **import** via the file chooser, screen keep-awake
  during live sessions, deep links, dark chrome everywhere.
- The web app detects the bridge and prefers it; in plain browsers it
  still uses Web Bluetooth, and the simulated demo works everywhere.
  Service-worker cache bumped to v42.
- CI rebuilt: the Android workflow now compiles the native shell with
  Gradle and publishes to the same `android-latest` release link.

Verified: all six suites pass (31-step browser smoke incl. the
Conditioning demo). The Bluetooth path itself needs real hardware — first
on-device pairing is the remaining validation step.


## Conditioning: live WHOOP heart-rate zone training — 22 July 2026

A fifth tab. Start a conditioning session, connect your WHOOP over
Bluetooth, and train by live heart rate — Morpheus-style.

- **Live capture, for real.** Uses WHOOP's official HR Broadcast (standard
  BLE Heart Rate Service) + Web Bluetooth. Second-by-second BPM with
  automatic reconnect if the signal drops. Works in Chrome on Android and
  desktop; the app detects unsupported browsers and says so plainly.
- **Three formats:** Steady-state (Zone 2 · 20 min), Intervals (8×30s/90s),
  Tempo (10×15s/60s) — warm-up and cool-down included, vibration cues on
  every phase change, round counter, phase clock.
- **Live screen** built once and updated in place (no flicker): zone gauge
  arc, big BPM colored by zone, avg/max, elapsed, and a live HR line
  colored by zone as it draws.
- **Results:** zone-time donut, whole-session HR graph colored by zone,
  max/avg HR, **60-second HR recovery** (peak-to-minute drop — the
  conditioning-fitness marker), and estimated calories. Sessions persist
  (2s-downsampled trace, capped at 40) and ride the normal cloud sync.
- **Zones from your physiology:** 3 bands (Low/Moderate/High) off max HR —
  220 − age by default, tested-max override in Settings → Training profile.
- **Demo mode** with simulated HR runs anywhere — try the whole flow
  without a band (also how CI exercises it, since headless browsers have
  no Bluetooth).
- Wake lock held during live sessions; service-worker cache bumped to v41;
  browser-smoke gains a Conditioning step (nav is now five tabs).

Verified: browser-smoke (31), torture (16), pentest (0 findings), and the
contract/deployment/pwa checks all pass.


## Progress view + Tier-3 polish: trends, skeletons, grain — 22 July 2026

Adds a fourth tab — **Progress** — that turns everything you log into a
picture over time, plus the last layer of visual finish.

- **Progress trends.** Three charts, all drawn as clean inline SVG (no
  libraries, CSP-safe): training **volume by week** (8-week bars), **planned
  vs felt RPE** (two-line, with a legend and direct end-labels), and **WHOOP
  recovery** over the last 14 days. Three stat tiles up top: sessions, kg
  this week, and current day-streak. Each chart has native hover tooltips
  and a single axis with a recessive grid.
- WHOOP recovery/strain is now **persisted daily** (`whoopDaily`, capped at
  120 days) every time status loads or a sync lands, so the recovery trend
  builds itself in the background with no extra work.
- **Empty state.** Before your first finished session, Progress shows a calm
  "nothing to chart yet" card instead of a blank screen; a tip nudges you to
  log target RPE so the planned-vs-felt trend can appear.
- **Skeleton loader.** The WHOOP card now shows a shimmering placeholder that
  matches its real shape while recovery loads, so the layout never jumps.
- **Grain + press feedback.** A barely-there film grain over the whole app
  and tactile :active states finish the Tier-3 pass. All honour
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v40.

Verified: browser-smoke (30), torture (16), pentest (0 findings), and the
contract/deployment/pwa checks all pass.


## UI/UX polish: real Inter, animated ring, press feedback, wake lock — 22 July 2026

- Loaded the real Inter typeface (self-hosted variable woff2, 72 KB) that
  the design was drawn for — previously it silently fell back to system
  fonts. Sharpens every number, heading and the tabular rest timer.
  CSP-safe (font-src 'self') and cached for offline.
- The WHOOP dual ring now animates up from zero to its value on render
  (registered @property arcs), instead of snapping. Honours
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- Tactile press feedback across cards, chips, buttons, nav and the week
  strip; a little confirmation pop when a set is ticked; a slightly
  richer screen-transition ease. All subtle and mock-faithful.
- Wake Lock: the screen stays awake on the Training/Logger screens during
  a live session, so your phone won't sleep between sets. Released when
  you leave; re-acquired when you return.
- Service-worker cache bumped to v39 (adds the font to the offline shell).

Verified: browser-smoke (29), torture (16), pentest (0 findings), and the
contract/deployment/pwa checks all pass.


## CSP hardening: no inline script, no unsafe-inline — 21 July 2026

Closes the one serious finding from the pen-test: the CSP previously
allowed script-src 'unsafe-inline', so any future XSS could read the
Supabase token from localStorage.

- Moved the entire app from an inline <script> into an external app.js,
  loaded with `defer` after the Supabase client. The page now has zero
  inline JavaScript.
- Replaced all 78 inline on* handlers (onclick/oninput/onchange) with a
  small CSP-safe event-delegation layer: markup carries
  data-click/-input/-change="fn" plus a JSON data-args array, with
  @self/@value/@checked/@event sentinels resolved at dispatch. Each site
  behaves exactly as before.
- Tightened the CSP to `script-src 'self'` — dropped 'unsafe-inline'.
  (style-src keeps it; inline styles are not a script-execution vector.)
- Service worker caches app.js; cache bumped to v38. Checks updated to
  read app.js; native-pwa-smoke now also asserts the shell has no inline
  script and no inline handlers, and that the delegation layer exists.

Verified: pen-test now reports 0 findings (was 1); browser-smoke (29),
torture (16), and all four contract/deploy/pwa checks pass.

## Hardening: XSS, corrupt storage, empty sessions — 21 July 2026

Ran a full workout end-to-end plus an adversarial torture pass. Four
real bugs surfaced and were fixed:

- **Stored XSS (serious):** an exercise name / tempo / set-target
  containing HTML executed when the Builder card rendered its
  prescription line, and in the logger's per-set target line. Both
  spots now escape the value (the prescription line elsewhere already
  went through the escaping path). Hostile input is shown as text.
- **Corrupt localStorage crashed boot:** a stored blob with the wrong
  types (workouts not an array, sessions a string, a workout with no
  blocks) threw on load. load() now runs every record through
  sanitizeDB(), coercing shapes and dropping junk, so the app always
  boots to a clean Home.
- **Empty session was "complete":** a session with no exercises passed
  the all-sets-done check by vacuous truth. sessionAllDone() now
  requires at least one exercise, and the Builder refuses to preview a
  workout with no blocks/exercises.

Three of these are now covered by committed browser-smoke steps.
Service-worker cache bumped to v37.

## Max reps (AMRAP) — 21 July 2026

- New "Max reps" tracking mode in the Builder for lifts where every set is
  max reps at whatever's on the bar: set rows show "max reps" instead of a
  target input, the prescription line reads "3 × max", and the logger keeps
  KG / Reps / RPE felt columns so the achieved numbers still get recorded.
- Mixed schemes work too: typing "max" (or just "m") as any single set's
  target renders prescriptions like "12/10/max" and shows "target max reps"
  for that set in the logger.
- History summaries and the Strength/Conditioning card labels treat Max
  reps work as strength.
- Two new browser-smoke steps; service-worker cache bumped to v36.

## One training destination: the Logger tab is gone — 21 July 2026

- The nav is now Home · Training · Builder. Training is the single place
  you go to train; the set-by-set logger opens by tapping an exercise row
  and keeps its Previous/Next stepping, "Next exercise →" hand-off, and
  in-place "Mark session complete" — it just isn't a competing tab anymore.
- While logging, the Training tab stays highlighted (the logger is its
  detail view).
- Browser smoke asserts the three-tab nav and the tap-in/step-through flow.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v35.

## Training and Logger get distinct jobs — 21 July 2026

- Training is the map: the whole session at a glance, supersets and
  completion rows ticked in place, and the finish button.
- Logger is the flow: the Logger tab now always resumes at your next
  unfinished exercise (never an arbitrary one), shows "exercise N of M"
  in the header, and steps ‹ Previous / Next › through the session's
  loggable exercises without bouncing back to Training.
- When you tick an exercise's last set, a "Next exercise: … →" button
  appears; when every set in the session is done, the Logger offers
  "Mark session complete" right there.
- Browser smoke grew two steps covering the resume-and-step behavior.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v34.

## WHOOP-style dual ring, details hidden by default — 21 July 2026

- The Home WHOOP card now draws WHOOP's own picture: inner ring is recovery
  in WHOOP's colors (green ≥67, yellow 34–66, red <34), outer ring is strain
  in WHOOP blue, filling further around as the day's strain (0–21) climbs.
- Numbers stay out of your head: by default the card shows only the rings —
  no percentages, no metrics, no advice. Tapping the card reveals recovery,
  strain, HRV/RHR/sleep and the Readiness line; tapping again hides them.
  Details always start hidden on each visit.
- Settings moved to the WHOOP chip on the card (tap the chip, not the card).
- Browser smoke covers the new behavior: readiness stays hidden after a
  session until the card is tapped, and collapses again on a second tap.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v33.

## History, readiness, scheduling & a calmer Builder — 21 July 2026

- History: every day in the week strip is now tappable and opens a History
  screen with previous/next-day navigation, showing each finished session's
  exercises with their logged sets (60kg × 12 @RPE 8 style), completed or
  incomplete.
- Readiness card on Home: combines WHOOP recovery with the last week's
  target-vs-felt RPE gap into one plain-language line — green light, train
  as planned, or pull back. Hidden until there is data.
- Weekly scheduling: the Builder gains "Train on" day chips. Home orders
  today's scheduled session first ("Today · Strength + Conditioning"),
  labels the rest by their days, says "Rest day" honestly, and the week
  strip rings upcoming planned days like the mock.
- Rest timer: now survives reload and screen-lock (end-time persisted),
  recomputes from wall clock, and vibrates when it hits zero.
- Stale sessions: an unfinished session from a previous day no longer hogs
  the resume card forever — with logged work it becomes an "incomplete"
  history entry, empty ones are dropped.
- Logger: the kg field shows last time's weight as its placeholder
  ("60 last") so you stop retyping your working weight.
- Calmer Builder: identical set targets collapse into one "All sets" row
  with a "vary per set →" toggle (12/10/8/8-style ramps still expand);
  tempo/rest hide behind a "+ tempo · rest" disclosure until an exercise
  uses them; adding a set now copies the previous set's RPE too.
- Cloud sync: "Forgot password?" flow (reset email + in-app new password).
- New checks/browser-smoke.mjs drives the real app in headless Chromium —
  20 end-to-end steps including the reload-survival rest timer — with a
  built-in static server; it skips politely when playwright isn't installed.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v32.

## Ground-up rebuild on the design mock — 21 July 2026

- Rebuilt index.html from the ground up as the design mock, exactly: Home
  (welcome, Sunday-first week strip, today's session card, WHOOP mini-card),
  Training (block day view with supersets and prescription lines), Logger
  (set-by-set with per-mode columns, targets, RPE felt, auto rest chip) and
  Builder (collapsible blocks, five tracking modes, live prescription line).
- The whole backend is untouched: all six Netlify functions, WHOOP OAuth,
  Supabase cloud sync (same app_state schema), the hybrid-engine-v1
  localStorage model, the nameless template seed, and export/import backups.
- Logger no longer exposes add/remove-set steppers (the mock has none) — set
  counts live in the Builder.
- The WHOOP home card now renders exactly like the mock's recovery card
  (conic ring plus HRV · RHR · Sleep line) with Strong/Steady/Low labels, and
  quietly re-syncs once a day when the stored sample is stale.
- Removed the stale packaged app/ copy, the unreferenced pwa.js and
  native-ui.css leftovers, and two checks tied to the deleted focused-ui
  architecture; rewrote checks/native-pwa-smoke.mjs for the real
  architecture and refreshed readme.txt (deployment env vars and production
  WHOOP URLs included).
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v31 so installed PWAs pick up the
  rebuild.

## RPE hardening pass — 21 July 2026

- Fixed an edge case where switching an exercise to "For completion" could leave stale target RPE/tempo attached, which then showed a spurious "Felt" column in the logger. Completion mode now clears RPE/tempo on switch and on save, and the runner refuses to show a Felt column for completion exercises even on older saved data.
- Target RPE and Felt RPE inputs now constrain to 1–10 in 0.5 steps and clamp invalid entries on input.

## Desktop sidebar layout — 21 July 2026

- On wide screens (≥940px) the bottom navigation reflows into a left sidebar rail, matching the design mock; below 940px the original bottom-nav PWA layout is unchanged. Purely additive CSS on the existing nav — no markup change, fully reversible, and mobile is byte-for-byte as before.

## Per-set RPE + tempo (FBB-style) — 21 July 2026

- Builder: each set now has an optional target RPE beside its rep/second target, plus an optional Tempo field per exercise (e.g. 30X1). Both are optional — leave them blank and everything behaves exactly as before, with no change to existing saved templates.
- Live logger: when an exercise has target RPE, the strength runner shows the target ("· RPE 8") next to each set and adds a compact "Felt" column so you can log the RPE you actually hit. Exercises with no RPE render identically to before (no extra column).
- Prescriptions everywhere (Builder card, template preview, live runner) now append the RPE range and tempo, e.g. "4 × 12/10/8 · RPE 7→9 · @30X1".
- Data model: exercise gains optional `rpe` (comma list, parallel to `reps`) and `tempo` (string); set rows gain optional `rpe` (target) and `feltRpe` (logged). Fully backward-compatible — no migration, older rows upgrade lazily on load.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v27.

## UI polish pass — 19 July 2026

- Training no longer says "Training" twice back to back — removed the duplicate title/tagline card at the top of the screen, kept the useful line and the Programs/Resources toggle.
- Quieted the small gold tagline above each screen's title (e.g. "Plan and review" above Calendar) everywhere except Home, so it reads as a light touch rather than repeating marketing copy on every screen.
- In the Builder, the block/exercise action row (Edit, move up/down, Copy, Delete) now wraps cleanly on narrow screens instead of crowding, with a touch more space before Delete so it doesn't sit flush against Copy.

## Recovery balance folded into the WHOOP card — 19 July 2026

- Moved Training impact out of its own card and into the WHOOP recovery snapshot on Home, as a small "Recovery balance" strip right below Sleep/HRV/Resting HR/Strain — Easy, Strength and High-intensity side by side.
- Same real data as before (your logged sessions vs. your synced recovery scores), just folded into the screen where you already look at WHOOP data instead of taking up its own separate card.

## Training impact moved to Home, now a bar chart — 19 July 2026

- Moved the Training impact card from History to Home, right below This week — it's a daily insight, so it belongs on the screen you actually open every day, not buried in your workout history.
- Changed it from a plain list of numbers to an actual bar chart, so the difference between Easy aerobic, Strength and High-intensity conditioning reads at a glance instead of needing to compare digits.
- No change to the underlying data or math — same real sessions, same real synced recovery scores, same small-sample caveat.

## Training impact: next-day recovery by session type — 19 July 2026

- Added a "Training impact" card to History showing your average synced WHOOP recovery the morning after Easy aerobic, Strength, and High-intensity conditioning sessions — using your own logged workouts and your own synced recovery scores, no invented formula.
- Answers "is my training actually affecting my recovery" directly from your real data, instead of guessing at a weighting scheme.
- Shows the session count behind each average and flags when a category has fewer than 5 sessions, since small samples shouldn't be read as a firm conclusion.
- WHOOP sync now also pulls recovery history (same rolling-window / one-time-backfill approach as the strain history added earlier), so this has real data to work with from the first sync after this update.

## Fitness trend chart from WHOOP strain — 19 July 2026

- Added a Fitness trend card to History showing Fitness (42-day trend), Fatigue (7-day trend) and Form, calculated from your daily WHOOP strain — the same idea as TrainingPeaks' Performance Management Chart, built from data you already sync.
- Only appears once WHOOP is connected and syncing; nothing changes if WHOOP isn't connected. Shows a "still gathering data" message until about a week of strain history has built up.
- The first WHOOP sync after this update automatically pulls a longer history (up to ~100 days) once, in the background, so the chart has a real trend to show instead of starting from nothing. Every sync after that stays light (a small rolling window), same as before.
- Purely calculated from your own synced data on your device — no new data leaves your phone beyond the existing WHOOP sync call.

## UI/UX cleanup — 19 July 2026

- Fixed a long-standing bug where reloading the app while it was on the Training tab could show a blank/broken screen. The app now waits until everything has fully loaded before it draws the first screen, instead of racing it.
- Deleting a block or exercise in the Builder now always shows the app's own "Delete this? Yes/No" prompt, matching template deletion. The browser's native pop-up confirmation is no longer used anywhere.
- Removed the "Show advanced" toggle in the Builder. Move up/down, Copy and Delete are now always visible on every block and exercise — nothing is hidden behind an extra tap.

## Nothing locked, free reordering — 19 July 2026

- Retired the built-in "Strength Day 1" and "Strength Day 2" seed templates. They were locked/protected (no Edit or Delete option); existing copies are automatically removed from your saved data the next time the app loads, no action needed.
- No template is locked or protected anymore, for these or any future templates — every template gets a normal Edit and Delete option, with the existing "Delete this template? Yes/No" confirmation before anything is removed.
- Removed the hard rule that kept Warm-up first and Cool-down last in the Builder. All blocks, including Warm-up and Cool-down, can now be freely moved up and down like any other block.

## Cloud sync (Supabase) — 19 July 2026

- Added optional cross-device sync: sign in from Settings → Cloud sync (email + password via Supabase Auth) and your training log syncs to every device you sign into.
- The app stays local-first: it works fully offline from browser storage whether or not you're signed in, and only talks to Supabase when a change needs to sync.
- Data model is one JSON row per account, protected by Supabase Row Level Security — nobody but you can read or write your row, even though the anon key ships in the app (that's expected/safe for Supabase; RLS is the actual boundary).
- Conflict handling is last-write-wins by real content: if the same data exists on both sides nothing happens; if it differs, whichever device has the more recent genuine change wins. Two devices editing offline at the same time can still overwrite each other — there's no merge.
- Requires a one-time setup: create a Supabase project, run `supabase-schema.sql` in its SQL editor, and add the project's URL + anon key to `index.html`.

## Fresh start after TrainHeroic cleanup — 18 July 2026

- Removed the bundled TrainHeroic import, raw export files, old baseline notes and legacy test harness from the working bundle.
- Existing installs now purge all TrainHeroic-derived sessions, exercises and templates on load or import; the new Block 01 strength templates remain.
- Calendar and history start clean without repopulating old TrainHeroic data.

## Logger and Builder tracking rebuild — 18 July 2026

- Rebuilt per-exercise tracking modes in Builder: Reps + Kilos, Seconds, Reps + Seconds, Reps only, and For completion. Each strength exercise stores one saved mode.
- Builder now lays each set on its own row for per-set targets, with a live prescription preview and a tracking-mode chip on each exercise.
- Live Logger renders only the fields for the chosen mode and adds a dedicated Done column. Removed the set-count/extra-set stepper and the rest-prescription line from the strength runner; the programmed rest timer is kept.
- The exercise session cue now appears as an instruction banner at the top of the live logger.
- Superset logger and edit sheet respect each exercise's tracking mode; the read-only round overview is retained.
- Tonnage counts weighted modes only; Seconds, Reps only and For completion contribute no load.
- Legacy templates and sessions without a saved mode default to Reps + Kilos — no data migration required.
- Removed the now-unreachable manual extra-set add/remove helpers left over from the previous logger.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v12 so installed PWAs pick up the rebuild.
- %1RM mode was intentionally deferred from this pass.

## Logger and Builder reset — 15 July 2026

- Removed the focused Logger/Builder overlay and its late override wiring.
- Returned both routes to the core app foundation for a clean rebuild.
- Removed the focused UI asset from the service-worker shell and bumped the
  cache version.
- Preserved WHOOP, Netlify functions, local storage, history, and recovery.

## Locked Logger and Builder tracking — 15 July 2026

- Reworked the focused Builder so Sets occupy their own row and each strength exercise chooses one saved tracking mode: Reps + Kilos, Reps + %1RM, Seconds, Reps + Seconds, Reps only or For completion.
- Added Builder-owned exercise instructions that appear at the top of the live Logger, plus a read-only superset round overview.
- Made the live Logger render only the fields selected in Builder, with a dedicated Completed column and no mode, set-count, extra-set, history or rest-prescription controls.
- Kept actual result entry, notes, navigation and the programmed rest timer available during the session.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to v6 so the new Logger/Builder reaches installed PWAs.

## First-cycle templates — 15 July 2026

- Added blank native Library templates for Full Body Day 1 — Bench, Full Body Day 2 — Squat and Full Body Day 3 — Deadlift.
- Preserved the recovered exercise order and the Day 2 Pendlay Row naming note.
- Kept all set, rep and load prescriptions empty; the Logger now adds the first set only when the athlete chooses it.
- Added map “+” controls to group adjacent strength exercises into supersets.
- Repaired map movement for instruction blocks so Warm-up can move to the top and Cool-down can move to the bottom.

## Streamlined build — 13 July 2026

- Removed legacy readiness and program-first clutter from the primary flow.
- Home now focuses on active, scheduled and newly created workouts.
- Calendar starts workouts directly without an extra preview step.
- Library cards now use Edit in Builder and Schedule as the primary actions.
- Strength logging is limited to the prescribed work and recorded results.
- Conditioning creation is limited to Easy aerobic and Intervals.
- Removed obsolete seeded templates, archived-template persistence and dead recovery data.
- Corrected the default weekly schedule to Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
- Fixed root Netlify PWA manifest paths and reduced duplicate service-worker caching.

## Completion pass — 13 July 2026

- Added deliberate route coverage for Logger, Summary, History and Builder tools.
- Added completed-workout History list and stale-route normalization.
- Protected canonical system templates during imports and kept custom imports visible.
- Throttled interval checkpoints and exposed independent main/recovery save health.
- Replaced the incomparable combined load score with separate strength and conditioning signals.
- Normalized conditioning modality alternatives and added a credential-free WHOOP boundary contract.

## Visual finish — 13 July 2026

- Preserved the existing palette, typography, branding and component structure.
- Added geometry-only mobile safety polish for long labels, narrow grids and fixed navigation spacing.
- Bumped the service-worker cache so the visual-only pass reaches fresh installs and updates.

## Domain and privacy setup — 14 July 2026

- Added the public privacy policy page at `/privacy.html`.
- Added the `/privacy` route and no-cache headers for the policy page.
- Documented explicit HTTPS configuration for the WHOOP callback URLs.
## 2026-07-14 — Function-enabled integrations

- Added Netlify Functions for WHOOP OAuth, token refresh, sync, disconnect, and webhook handling.
- Added encrypted server-side token storage using Netlify Blobs; no provider secrets or tokens enter the static app.
- Added a compact Connected data entry point inside Settings without changing the main navigation, colors, or core logging flow.
- Added OAuth state/session protection, WHOOP HMAC verification, webhook deduplication, and a cache version bump.
- Hardened WHOOP V2 pagination, date normalization, timeout/error handling, rotating refresh-token races, stale webhook rejection, and provider revocation on disconnect.
- Added a WHOOP Sync control and compact recovery, sleep, HRV, resting-heart-rate and strain summary in Settings.
- Fixed Netlify Lambda-compatible Blobs initialization so OAuth state, encrypted tokens, sync records and webhook deduplication can persist in production Functions.
- Switched the Blobs store to Lambda-compatible eventual consistency so integration status reads do not require an unavailable uncached edge URL.
- Added a WHOOP-style Today recovery card to Home with recovery score, sleep, HRV, resting heart rate, strain, connection states and one-tap sync.
## Strength Block 01 logger update

- Added the fixed 4-week strength block with two sessions and the agreed exercise prescriptions.
- Added simple Working Max and Last-session context to the live strength logger.
- Bumped the service-worker cache so installed PWAs receive the updated logger.
