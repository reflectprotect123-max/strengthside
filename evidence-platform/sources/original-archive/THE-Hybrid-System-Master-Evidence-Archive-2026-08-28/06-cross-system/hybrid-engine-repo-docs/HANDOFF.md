What one session worked out, written down before the container holding it was
reclaimed. A chat cannot be merged into another chat; a file in the repo can be
read by any session, on any machine, forever. That asymmetry is the only reason
this document exists.

Sections 2–5 and 7 were verified against the tree at `8275360`; sections 1 and 6
were re-verified against `b5bc201`. Nothing here is a commitment to build —
section 4 is a proposal, and it is marked as one.

## 1. Where the code is

The real monorepo is **`reflectprotect123-max/THE-HYBRID-ENGINE1`**. It was
renamed from `the-hybrid-engine1`; pushes to the old name still redirect, so a
stale remote works but reports the move.

**It is the only live repository.** The owner has confirmed that every other
repo on the account is dead — not a component, not a deploy target, not a
staging copy. Nothing in any of them is a dependency of this one, and nothing
in any of them should be read, copied, revived, or cited as prior art. If a
task seems to need one of them, the task is wrong about where the code is.

The other twelve, so no session has to wonder which is which:

| Repo | Why it is not this one |
|---|---|
| `THEhybridsystem` | Empty — no commits, no files. The dangerous one; see below |
| `the-hybrid-engine-render` | Superseded deploy target. This repo deploys via Netlify |
| `THE-HYBRID-ENGINE-newest` | Archived. Named "newest"; it is not |
| `hybrid-engine` | Superseded |
| `TheHYBRIDENGINE` | Archived |
| `THE-Hybrid-engine---netlify` | Superseded Netlify attempt |
| `THE-Hybrid-engine` | Superseded |
| `Hybrid-app` | Superseded |
| `the-coach-brain`, `thebrain` | Earlier unrelated experiments |
| `claude-code-skills`, `desktop-tutorial` | Not this project at all |

`THEhybridsystem` deserves the specific warning, because its name is the one
this project calls itself and it contains **nothing** — no commits, no files,
no branches. A session pointed at it sees a bare directory and concludes the
project does not exist. If you are reading this and your working directory
looks empty, that is what happened; you are in the wrong repo. This has now
cost two sessions: one lost most of its length to it, and a later one opened
by reporting the project had never been started.

## 2. The coach dashboard already exists

`apps/coach/src/Dashboard.tsx` (334 lines, added in `c938c2c` and `8275360`) is
a working self-coached dashboard: five tiles (last trained, this week's tonnage
with a percentage delta, sessions per twelve weeks, WHOOP readiness, movement
count), a twelve-week volume bar chart, the best six lifts by e1RM over six
months, and a derived-notes panel.

Every number in it goes through `@hybrid/engine`. None are recomputed locally —
a coach screen disagreeing with the phone about a number is worse than a coach
screen that does not exist.

**An empty dashboard is almost always a data problem, not a missing feature.**
It reads the signed-in user's own row from Supabase `app_state`
(`apps/coach/src/cloud.tsx:99`), with the engine database nested under
`state.hybridEngine`. Five distinct empty states each name a different cause:
signed out, still loading, read refused, no row for this account, and a row with
nothing under it. In practice the answer is nearly always one of:

- the coach app is signed in with a **different email** than the phone syncs to;
- the phone has never **completed a sync**, so the data is still only on the
  device that logged it.

The dashboard shows the signed-in user's *own* training. Reading another
athlete's would need a new RLS policy, and that was left as a deliberate privacy
decision rather than inherited from a convenient query.

## 3. What the data model can and cannot support

From `packages/engine/src/types.ts`. This section is the important one — it
decides which analyses are possible at all.

**Present:**

| Signal | Where |
|---|---|
| `LoggedSet.felt` — the athlete's actual RPE, 1–10 | per set |
| `LoggedSet.aVal` / `aVal2` — kg and reps | per set |
| `Session.startedAt` / `completedAt` | per session |
| `CondResult.hrr` — heart-rate recovery | `settings.conditioning[]` |
| `CondResult.zsec` — seconds banked per HR zone, and `dur` | same |
| `whoopDaily[]` — `restingHr`, `hrvMs`, `sleepPerformance`, `recoveryScore` | settings |
| `liftProgress` — the working weight each movement has earned | settings |

**Absent — and this rules things out:** there is **no distance, no pace, no GPS,
no splits** anywhere in the model. Running is a `CondBlock` plus a `CondResult`:
heart-rate zones, duration, and recovery. Any analysis of the form "you ran the
same route faster at the same effort" is therefore **not computable** without a
model change — new fields, a migration, logger UI, and some way to get the data
in. Do not design around pace without doing that work first.

The compensating signal is that **effort is recorded on both sides of the
hybrid**: `felt` on every strength set, `felt` and `hrr` and zone-seconds on
every conditioning session. Output-per-unit-of-effort is the one metric that
spans lifting and running in this dataset, which makes it the natural spine for
anything comparative.

## 4. The insights engine — built

The motivating goal was stated as: *see that you are getting fitter without
having noticed*. Descriptive stats cannot do that — tonnage and session counts
report what you already lived through. The mechanism that can is **comparing you
against your own past self at matched effort**, because effort always feels like
effort and so the improvement is invisible from the inside.

`packages/engine/src/insights.ts` now exists and exports
`insights(db: EngineDB, now?: Date): Insight[]`. Each `Insight` carries its own
evidence — sample counts per window, the window length, and a from/to metric —
so a surface never recomputes the number it is printing and cannot contradict
the claim it is making. 27 tests in `packages/engine/test/insights.test.ts`.

Five detectors landed as proposed:

1. **Strength at matched felt-RPE** — e1RM compared only within a shared `felt`
   bucket, per movement. The headline: same effort, more weight.
2. **Heart-rate recovery** — trend `CondResult.hrr`.
4. **Work rate** — `sessionVolume(s)` ÷ elapsed minutes, only between sessions
   sharing a `workoutId`. Elapsed time is clamped to 5–300 minutes: a session
   left open overnight would otherwise invent a huge improvement.
5. **Volume tolerance** — tonnage rising while mean `felt` is flat or falling.
   Conditional, not comparative: rising tonnage alone is not a finding, because
   the athlete knows they added a set.
6. **Zone efficiency** — `zsec.high` at matched `felt`, as a **share** of banked
   time rather than raw seconds, so a longer run is not mistaken for a better
   one.

**Detector 3 was not buildable as written, and this is the important part.**
The sketch said "resting HR / HRV drift — 28-day means from `whoopDaily`".
There is no such history to take a mean of: both write paths
(`apps/web/src/cloud/whoop.tsx`, `apps/mobile/src/cloud/whoop.tsx`) persist
exactly `{ date, recovery, strain }`, capped at 120 rows. Resting HR, HRV and
sleep performance arrive on the live `WhoopSample` and are dropped before
storage. It ships as **recovery-score drift** instead, which is in the data.
Widening the stored row is the change that would unlock the original — the same
shape of blocker as the missing pace data in section 3.

**The rule that keeps it honest:** a detector returns nothing below a minimum
sample size and nothing inside a relative-change floor. An engine that invents
a trend from four data points is worse than no engine, because it costs you
trust in the true findings. Half the test file asserts silence for that reason.
Two further rules follow from the same principle: declines are reported with
`improved: false` rather than suppressed, since an engine that only delivered
good news would say nothing the first time an athlete was overreaching; and
nothing is truncated — every qualifying finding is returned, sorted strongest
first, for the surface to slice.

**Wired into Progress on both athlete surfaces** — `apps/web/src/screens/
Progress.tsx` and `apps/mobile/src/screens/Progress.tsx` — above the charts,
because it is the only thing on that screen you could not have worked out by
looking at them. Each finding shows its own sample counts: four sets against
four is a different claim from twenty against twenty, and hiding that would
make the two look equally certain.

**Still outstanding:** the three hand-written note rules in `Dashboard.tsx` —
stale lift, zero-tonnage weeks, no felt RPE — are still the only derivations on
that screen with no test coverage, and are the natural next thing to move into
the engine beside these.

### The readiness tile was broken the whole time

Found while wiring this up, and worth recording because of how it hid.
`Dashboard.tsx` cast `whoopDaily` rows to `WhoopSample` and passed them to
`todayRecovery`, which reads `recoveryScore`. A stored row has `recovery`. So
the coach dashboard's readiness tile showed a dash on every dashboard, for
every athlete, however well WHOOP was syncing — and a dash is also exactly
what the tile correctly shows when nothing has synced, so the broken state and
the healthy empty state were indistinguishable. It type-checked, threw
nothing, and rendered without complaint.

Fixed by mapping the field rather than casting, and now covered by
`apps/coach/test/dashboard.test.ts`. Note the second trap that test caught, in
the first version of the fix: passing the row's `null` straight through gives
`Number(null)` → `0`, a finite zero that bands as LOW and tells the athlete to
pull back because of a HOLE in the data. Absent readings must reach the
accessors as `undefined`. `recoveryBand` documents the same hazard.

This is one more reason to read section 2 carefully before concluding a bare
dashboard is a data problem: sometimes it is a bug.

## 5. Codex MCP does not work here — do not re-diagnose it

Attempted, and blocked at the environment level:

- `@openai/codex` resolves and installs fine (v0.145.0). Installation is not the
  problem.
- The egress proxy returns **403 on CONNECT** to `api.openai.com` and
  `chatgpt.com` — the organization's network policy declining those hosts.
  `github.com` and `api.anthropic.com` tunnel fine, so it is host-specific, not
  a broken proxy. Per `/root/.ccr/README.md`, a 403 is a policy denial and must
  be reported rather than retried or routed around.
- No `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `CODEX_API_KEY` in the environment.
- `codex login` via ChatGPT is not viable either: `chatgpt.com` is blocked, and
  a headless container has no browser handoff.

Both blockers are environment settings at claude.ai/code — network policy and
environment variables — read at container creation. They cannot be fixed from
inside a running session, and anything installed by hand dies with the
container. See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web.

Worth deciding deliberately: allowing egress to `api.openai.com` means an agent
in this container can send repository source to OpenAI.

## 6. Branch state

As of this revision, `claude/app-troubleshooting-c69lw9` carries only this
document and is rebased onto `origin/main` at `b5bc201`. It had drifted three
commits behind while holding two of its own, which is the state to expect if
nobody merges it.

The rule that produced that state still applies. A merged pull request is
finished and cannot track new work, so if you find this branch fully merged,
recreate it from the default branch rather than stacking on merged history:

```
git fetch origin main
git checkout -B claude/app-troubleshooting-c69lw9 origin/main
```

## 7. Repo facts worth knowing before you start

- `packages/engine` is the single source of the training model and is consumed
  as **TypeScript source**, no build step.
- **`apps/coach/src/model.ts` is the one real duplication**: a parallel
  `CoachSession`/`CoachBlock`/`CoachEx` shape with short keys, converted to the
  engine's types at publish time. It can author neither warm-up blocks nor text
  blocks, so the athlete-side Planner can express two block kinds the coach
  builder cannot.
- Coach programmes live in `localStorage` under `hybrid-coach-v1` and **never
  sync**. Only published sessions cross to the athlete, as snapshot rows in the
  Supabase `assignments` table. Clearing that browser's storage loses the
  programmes.
- **No charting library is installed anywhere.** Every chart is hand-built from
  `div`/`View` bars or an inline `<svg>` path, sharing `barScale` for the axis.
  That is a deliberate choice, not an omission.
- A planned set is exactly `{ t, rpe }`. Two test suites enforce that a planned
  set can never carry logged fields, because the moment it can, publishing a
  plan can overwrite an athlete's logged work.
- `pnpm verify` is typecheck → test → build:site → check:csp → smoke →
  smoke:deploy. It does **not** include the Metro/Hermes bundle, despite that
  bundle being the only thing that catches what `tsc` cannot about the phone.
  CI runs it as a separate step, so a green local `verify` can still be a
  mobile app that will not bundle. Run `pnpm --filter @hybrid/mobile bundle`
  yourself before pushing mobile or engine changes.

## 8. Deployment, verified rather than assumed

Both pipelines fire from a push to `main`, and both were confirmed live at
`63036ef` rather than inferred from config.

**Web — Netlify project `thehybridengine1`.** The push produced deploy
`6a690b5c…`, state `ready`, published in 23s: 6 functions, 19 redirect rules,
10 header rules, secret scan clean over 204 files.

The trap: `deploy_source` is **`api`**, not the GitHub App. So Netlify posts
**no commit status and no GitHub deployment** back to the repo. A session that
checks GitHub for a deploy status finds nothing and will wrongly conclude the
site is not wired up. It is. Check the Netlify project, not GitHub.

**Phone — EAS Update.** `mobile-ota.yml` publishes automatically on a push to
`main` touching `apps/mobile/**`, `packages/{engine,design,config}/**` or
`pnpm-lock.yaml`. A docs-only commit correctly triggers nothing.

Both mobile workflows exit GREEN when `EXPO_TOKEN` is missing, so **a green
tick does not mean a build happened**. Verify by the steps that ran: a real
update runs `Publish EAS Update`, a real build runs `EAS build (Android)`;
on the skip path checkout never runs at all. Both secrets are present and both
have done real work.

**What still cannot ship automatically:** any native change. `runtimeVersion`
is pinned to `"1"`, and an update only reaches a phone whose installed build
declares the same string — so a native change needs `runtimeVersion` bumped in
the same commit plus a fresh APK from `mobile-eas.yml`, dispatched by hand.
