# The RPE progression system

**Date:** 16 August 2026
**Status:** design, approved in conversation, not yet implemented
**Evidence base:** `docs/research/2026-08-16-progression-evidence-answer.md`
**Supersedes nothing.** Extends the fold, the banking layer and
`decideStrengthProgression`, all of which already exist.

---

## 1. Why this exists

The engine already autoregulates on RPE twice — once inside a session and once
between them — and both are live. What it cannot do is survive a change of rep
scheme, which is the ordinary case for anyone following a programme.

The owner put the problem in one line: *"what if one week its 10,8,6 then the
next its 9,7,5 or 8,6,4 an or 3 x 5 or 5/3/1"*.

Run against the real engine functions, the same athlete should open at:

| Scheme | Correct opener | What the app offers today |
|---|---|---|
| 10, 8, 6 | 100.0 kg | 100.0 |
| 9, 7, 5 | 102.5 kg | 100.0 |
| 8, 6, 4 | 105.0 kg | 100.0 |
| 3 × 5 | 112.5 kg | 100.0 |
| 5/3/1, the single | 132.5 kg | 100.0 |

*(Corrected after Stage 1 shipped: the right column originally read 102.4 /
113.5 / 131.3 — the RAW `plannedKg` division, e.g. 102.4390243902439 kg,
truncated to one decimal as if it were already rack-rounded. It reached the
athlete's actual weight field the same way, unrounded, until an audit of this
stage found it and `nextWorkingWeight` gained the `increment` parameter that
rounds it — see Stage 1's note below and `lift.test.ts`'s golden test for the
real, verified numbers.)*

**The engine computes the correct column and then throws it away.**
`anchorFor(100, {reps: 10, rpe: 8})` returns a 140 kg e1RM, and `plannedKg`
prices every later set off it — that is how 10 → 8 → 6 gets heavier within one
session. At the final whistle `liftMoves` banks `{kg: 100}` and the anchor is
gone. `LiftState` even carries a `reps` field whose comment reads *"reps it was
earned at, so a changed rep target is visible in the record"* — and
`nextWorkingWeight` reads `st.kg` and nothing else.

CLAUDE.md has carried this as an open gap since the lab was deleted: *"a
`10,8,6` → `9,7,5` wave moves no weight at all. That gap is still open."*

## 2. What "perfect" means here, and what it cannot mean

The commissioned review's central result is negative and governs everything
below:

> "No convincing experiment was located that randomised comparable trainees to
> approximately 2.5%, 5%, and 10% progression increments while holding
> exercise, target repetitions, progression trigger, volume, frequency, and
> context constant."

So there is no optimum to implement. What is achievable is a **controller**:
one that knows what it is looking at before it acts, moves one lever at a
time, treats holding as a real answer, and can always say why. Every number in
this design is a labelled heuristic. None is presented as a finding.

## 3. The design in one page

**The system stores a score, not a weight.** One number per movement — the
e1RM anchor — from which today's load is derived against today's rep target.

**The weight is pushed, not proposed.** It arrives prefilled in the athlete's
weight field with a one-line reason. There is no approval card and no second
number, because the fold's own rule stands: *a suggestion that disagrees with
the prefill is not a suggestion, it is two numbers contradicting each other on
the same card.*

**The athlete has the last word**, because the athlete is the one who knows
how today feels. Overriding the number is expected, not exceptional — and when
they do, they may leave one line saying why.

**Asymmetry is where the coaching lives.** Down is fast and needs no
confirmation; up is slow and needs two. That is the whole difference between a
coach and a calculator, and it is already how the fold behaves.

## 4. Stages

Ordered so that each is shippable on its own. Stage 1 and Stage 2 together fix
the owner's reported problem; the rest harden it.

### Stage 1 — bank the anchor, not the kilo

The single change everything else depends on.

**Store.** `LiftState` gains `e1rm?: number`. `kg` stays exactly as it is —
every session already logged keeps behaving identically, because a record with
no `e1rm` takes the existing path.

**Write.** `liftMoves` already computes `next.kg` (the next opener at this
session's scheme) and already reads the opening working set. It gains one
line: `anchorFor(next.kg, set1PlannedTarget)`, where the target is
`{reps: targetRepsOf(sets[0].t), rpe: rpeCenterOf(sets[0])}` — the same pair
`readExercise` builds. Warm-up sets are already excluded upstream.

**Read.** `openingLoadFor`'s *earned* rung prices
`plannedKg(e1rm, todaysSet1Target)` when an `e1rm` is banked and today's set 1
carries a numeric rep target. Otherwise it falls through to `kg`, unchanged.
**Rounded to the exercise's own increment before it reaches the athlete** —
`plannedKg` is a bare division and was reaching the weight field raw
(102.4390243902439 kg for the 9,7,5 scheme in the table below) until
`nextWorkingWeight` gained an `increment` parameter, found and fixed auditing
this stage after it shipped.

**Why it composes.** The anchor is derived from the weight the session
*earned*, so a session that went well raises the anchor and a scheme change
re-prices it — both at once, with no interaction rule:

```
week 1  10,8,6 @100, on target   → earned 100 @10 reps → anchor 140
week 2  plan says 9,7,5          → plannedKg(140, 9) → 102.5, rack-rounded
week 3  plan says 3×5            → plannedKg(140, 5) → 112.5, rack-rounded
crushed week 1 instead           → earned 102.5 → anchor 143.5 → week 2 ≈ 105, rack-rounded
```

*(These are rack-rounded — `nextWorkingWeight` rounds `plannedKg`'s output to
the exercise's own increment, `AUTOREG.plateIncrement` by default. That
rounding step was missing when this walkthrough was first written and reached
the athlete's actual field as a raw division; see §1's table note.)*

**Boundaries.** The anchor is never shown as a 1RM and never called one — it
is an internal reference. A bodyweight movement has no anchor. `max` sets have
no rep target to price against and take the existing path.

### Stage 2 — the reps rule: read the coach's syntax as intent

Ten lines, and it stops the engine overriding a coach.

- A single written number is an **instruction**. The engine prices load only
  and never suggests reps.
- A written **range** (`8-12`) is an **invitation**. Double progression is
  what the coach asked for, and the engine may climb inside it.

The two are already distinguishable from the existing parsers, but only
carefully: `repFloorOf` returns a NUMBER and `repTopOf` returns a STRING, so the
test is `repTopOf(t) === String(repFloorOf(t))` and never a bare `===`. Both run
the target through `withoutLoad` first, so `5 @80%` is still a single number.
`max` and an empty target give `repTopOf(t) === ''`, which is neither an
instruction nor an invitation — those take the existing path and are not touched
by this stage.

`decideStrengthProgression` already branches on `lastReps < repTop`; it does
not yet know that `repTop === repFloor` means *do not*. A wave — 10,8,6 —
is a sequence of instructions, so the engine must never propose an eleventh
rep on the 10.

### Stage 3 — validity before progression

The review is explicit that a success boolean is not enough: *"A set can be
completed because the athlete overshot the intended RPE, because the target
was too easy, because the exercise was changed, or because the user entered a
value without actually performing the set."*

An exposure is classified before it counts, from what is **already stored** —
no new capture on the logger. **Shipped** (16 August 2026):

| Class | Condition | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `successful` | met the rep floor, rated | counted, as before |
| `successful_but_uncertain` | met the floor, no rating logged | counts, but the fallback path now says so by name (`exposure_not_rated`, confidence `low`) instead of being absorbed into the generic `mixed_recent_results` hold |
| `missed` | below the rep floor | counted, as before |
| `incomplete` | no completed working set | needs no code — a session with no working set never produces a `StrengthExposure` at all, so it was already "ignored entirely" |

`ExposureClass` is computed and stored on every `StrengthExposure`, additive
metadata that the progression and deload gates do not yet read — only the
final fallback branch does, narrowly, to replace one generic hold reason with
an honest one. The two-in-a-row promotion gate (`last.onTarget && prev.onTarget`)
is unchanged: this stage makes the classification visible and improves one
hold message, it does not let an uncertain exposure promote at reduced
confidence. That is a larger, riskier change to a safety-relevant decision
tree with 199 existing pinned tests, and it is deferred rather than guessed
at — see below.

**Two classes did not ship, both for the same reason: no stored fact to
classify against.**

- **`pain_blocked`** — nothing in `LoggedSet` records a pain flag per set for
  a strength exercise. Conditioning has `mechanicalCompletion: 'pain_stop'`;
  strength has no counterpart. Reading `whole-athlete-state`'s
  `pain_hold_active` would answer a different question — whether pain is
  flagged *today*, not what a *past* exposure was — and would also mean
  `@hybrid/engine` depending on `@hybrid/whole-athlete-state`, which nothing
  in this repository does today (dependencies run the other way, both
  packages sit on `@hybrid/shared-core`). CLAUDE.md already records that
  nothing consumes `pain_hold_active` yet; this is that gap staying open, not
  a new one.
- **The "column pair changed" half of `successful_but_uncertain`** — no
  exposure field tracks which set-entry columns (`setColumns.ts`) a past
  session logged against, so there is nothing to compare today's pair to.

**Explicitly not built:** the review's full thirteen-field exposure record —
technique flags, rest interval, approved substitutions. Nobody answers those
mid-set. Recorded here as a declared gap rather than a silent one.

### Stage 4 — three load fields, never collapsed

> "The engine should retain `session_opening_load`, `effective_load`, and
> `last_successful_anchor_load` separately. Otherwise a failed session can
> cause an invisible compound reduction."

**Shipped as documentation and a pinning test, not a storage migration.**
Written before this stage as three DIFFERENT ideas below, they turned out to
already be three different reads over `sessions`, not one number wearing
three names:

- `lastSuccessfulAnchor` — `anchorKgFor(exposures)`, the most recent exposure
  that was actually on target.
- `openingLoad` — `exposure.kg`, what the set was actually loaded at.
- `effectiveLoad` — `earnedKgFrom(name, exposure)`, what `lift.ts`'s
  within-session fold walked the movement to by the end of that session.

Earlier language here proposed replacing `anchorKgFor`'s scan with a read of
a persisted fact. That would have been a regression, not a hardening:
`decideStrengthProgression` recomputes from `sessions` on every call, with no
persisted streak counter and no settings read — see the "is stateless" test
group — and a stored anchor is exactly the kind of state a bad session could
silently drift out of sync with. The re-derive-fresh design already IS the
protection Stage 4 asks for, proven by Example C passing before this stage
existed. What this stage adds is a comment naming the invariant explicitly at
`anchorKgFor`'s call site, and a test — `STAGE 4 — the three load fields stay
three different numbers` — that pins all three by name in the exact
100 → 94 → 94 scenario the review's Example C is a defect report about, rather
than only checking the final `deload` action gets the right number.

### Stage 5 — calibration after a layoff

The hole the owner found: *"a good day the 100kg is RPE 6 an then we come back
4 months later an theres stress/sleep issues an that 100kg is RPE9"*.

Two different causes needing two different answers:

**A bad patch while still training is already handled.** The fold catches it on
set one — a set rated 9 against a target of 8 is `dev = −1`, a full correction
and a lock, so set two is lighter immediately. The anchor re-banks lower at the
end of the session. **That drop is correct**: the athlete genuinely is
temporarily weaker. The system must not defend the old number. What it should
do is record *why* it fell, which is Stage 6.

**A layoff is not handled at all.** Nothing marks an anchor stale; four months
and four days are identical. Set one of the comeback is priced off a
four-month-old good day, and the athlete discovers it is too heavy by lifting
it — precisely the *"unnecessary failure exposure"* calibration exists to
prevent.

So a movement whose last exposure is older than the configured gap enters
**calibration**:

- it is not offered the full anchor-priced weight
- the session's purpose is to observe, not to progress
- its result is **recorded as a calibration exposure** and can never silently
  become the new anchor
- it leaves calibration on **two stable comparable exposures, not on a date** —
  the review is explicit: *"The calibration state should expire based on
  successful comparable exposures, not merely time."*

The gap threshold and the calibration reduction are both configured heuristics
and labelled as such.

**Shipped** (16 August 2026), against `AUTOREG.calibrationGapDays: 21` and
`AUTOREG.calibrationReductionPct: 0.1`, both spelled out as `product_heuristic`
in the constant's own doc, exactly as `deloadPct` was before the review priced
it. `calibrationStateFor(name, sessions, now?)` implements both halves of the
design in one function, in `packages/engine/src/adaptive/exposures.ts`:

- **Entry** — nothing logged since the gap opened: the trailing distance from
  `now` to the last exposure exceeds the threshold. The NEXT session is the
  comeback.
- **Exit** — walks every exposure for the most recent gap that crossed the
  threshold, then counts on-target exposures logged after it. Below two,
  still calibrating — explicitly NOT "is the gap still open", which would exit
  after one comeback session purely because that session's own timestamp
  reset the clock. That was the first version of this function and it failed
  its own test the moment the test asked for it by name.

**Both places that name a load are wired**, so the Library preview and the
Logger's own field cannot disagree during a comeback — the same invariant
`sessionOpeners`'s header already claimed for the recovery-ease case:

- `nextWorkingWeight` takes an additive 5th parameter, `sessions`, and returns
  early with a 10%-reduced weight and the note *"back after a break — offering
  less so today can find where you actually are"* when calibrating — ahead of
  the recovery-ease gate, not stacked with it, because one honest reduction
  with one honest reason beats a compounded cut across two sentences.
- `decideStrengthProgression` checks `calibrationStateFor` before
  `MIN_EXPOSURES`, not after — a movement can clear three exposures in raw
  count while still being one comeback session into a real layoff — and
  returns `hold` / `calibration_active` / `safetyState: 'reduced'` rather than
  letting a calibration exposure win the two-in-a-row promotion gate.

**One structural move this stage required**: `strengthExposuresFor` and the
new `calibrationStateFor` moved out of `adaptive/strength.ts` into a new
`adaptive/exposures.ts`. `strength.ts` imports `liftMoves` from `lift.ts`;
`lift.ts` now needs `calibrationStateFor` too, for the reason above. A module
that imports FROM `lift.ts` cannot also be imported BY it without a cycle, so
the shared primitive moved to a file that imports from neither. `strength.ts`
re-exports everything from it, so nothing at the package boundary changed.

**A note on how this was tested.** `calibrationStateFor`'s entry gate reads
real elapsed time against a session's `completedAt`, and the existing test
suites in `lift.test.ts` and `strength.test.ts` use small synthetic
timestamps (`1000`, `2000`, …) for ordering, not real dates — against the
actual wall clock every one of them is decades old, which made every
history-bearing test a false "back after a break" the first time this landed.
Both files now pin `vi.useFakeTimers` to a fixed point just above their
largest synthetic timestamp, which keeps `Date.now()` real-shaped without
requiring dozens of fixtures to be rewritten with realistic dates.

### Stage 6 — the override note

When the athlete changes the offered number, the app records what was offered,
what was taken, and offers **one optional line**: *"shoulder felt off"*,
*"slept 4 hours"*, *"felt great"*. Skippable. Never a form.

Two things this buys:

1. The coach stops seeing `95kg` and starts seeing *"we offered 102.5, he took
   95, his shoulder felt off."* One is data; the other is coaching.
2. The engine is told the miss was not about strength, so a bad week does not
   read as decline — the `successful_but_uncertain` path with a human reason
   attached.

**Shipped in two halves** (16 August 2026), and they are genuinely two halves
rather than one feature, because the second one has no screen to land on yet.

**The capture half is shipped, end to end.** `Draft` (`@hybrid/session-
authoring`) gains `offered` — the kg the engine offered, stamped once by
`openDraft` and never patched again — and `note`, the optional line. `applyDraft`
writes `LoggedSet.offeredKg`/`overrideNote` ONLY when `draft.kg !== draft.offered`;
an ordinary set that matched the offer records nothing extra, exactly as an
un-rated exposure records nothing extra elsewhere in this design. Both fields
join `FORBIDDEN_SET_KEYS` — logger-owned, same as `aVal`/`felt`/`done`, and a
coach's plan can never carry one. On the phone, `HotCard` reveals the note
field the moment the weight the athlete is holding differs from the weight
that was offered, labelled by name — *"you took 95kg, not the 102.5kg
offered — why? (optional)"* — never a validation error, never required by the
log gate. Both mobile parity gates (behaviour and visual, driven through the
real exported harness) pass unchanged, because neither scripted flow ever
edits the weight field away from the offer.

**The "coach sees" half is a declared gap, not a silent one.** Point 1 above —
*"the coach stops seeing 95kg and starts seeing…"* — has nowhere to land: no
screen on the coach bench shows a coach any athlete's individual logged sets
today. That is `#167`, `request_session_detail and the draft editor`, already
tracked and already pending before this design existed. Building a session-
detail viewer to give the override note its first reader is that task's scope,
not this stage's — recorded here so the gap is legible rather than discovered
later.

**Point 2 — the engine reading the note back — is also not wired**, for the
same honest reason `successful_but_uncertain` itself does not yet influence
promotion (see Stage 3): a human-typed reason attached to a miss is exactly
the kind of signal that should raise confidence rather than just being
displayed, and doing that properly means deciding how a free-text reason
maps to `dataLimitations`/`confidence` — a real design question, not a
follow-on of storage existing. `overrideNote` is captured and stored now
specifically so that decision has real data to be made against later, rather
than being made blind.

## 5. What the athlete sees

Unchanged in shape. The weight field, prefilled, with one line under it:

```
102.5 kg     what you earned last time, at nine
 95.0 kg     backed off — harder than asked
100.0 kg     coming back — let's see where you are      (calibration)
102.5 kg     on target twice — this is the step up
```

The line is not decoration. The fold already states the rule: *a number with no
reason attached is what athletes override.*

## 6. What the coach sees

Nothing new to approve — the athlete owns the number under the bar. The bench
gains what it currently lacks: the override record, and the reason attached to
it.

## 7. Boundaries this design does not cross

- **The anchor is not a 1RM** and is never labelled one.
- **Pain is not fatigue.** It routes to the safety pathway, not to a heavier
  penalty in the same formula. Note that nothing currently consumes
  `pain_hold_active` — Stage 3's `pain_blocked` class is the first consumer,
  and it blocks progression only. It does not reinstate the deleted session
  stop, which was removed deliberately on 14 August.
- **HRV stays advisory.** The existing recovery ease at the point of
  prescribing is unchanged; nothing here reads a wearable as a strength signal.
- **Nutrition never enters this.** Unchanged.
- **Every constant declares itself a heuristic.** The product may not claim
  2.5%, 5% or two misses are validated.

## 8. Testing

- **Stage 1 is golden-testable against the table in §1** — five schemes, one
  anchor, five expected openers, computed by the real functions.
- **Round trip:** a session with no `e1rm` behaves exactly as it does today.
  This is the compatibility assertion and it must be explicit.
- **Stage 2:** a wave (`10`, then `8`) never produces a rep suggestion; a range
  (`8-12`) does.
- **Stage 4:** the review's Example C — open 100, miss, corrected to 94, deload
  produces 95 and not 89.3 — already passes and must keep passing.
- **Stage 5:** calibration is entered on a gap, exited on two stable exposures
  and never on elapsed time alone; a calibration exposure never becomes an
  anchor.
- **The golden constants pin** covers `progressPct`, `maxJumpPct` and
  `deloadPct` already, and gains the calibration constants.

## 9. Open questions, stated rather than hidden

1. **The calibration gap threshold** has no evidence behind it. The review
   declines to give one — *"Detraining evidence does not provide a universal
   time-off-to-load-reduction equation."* It will be a configured guess,
   labelled, and it should be revisited against real data.
2. **RPE calibration per athlete** — the review suggests tracking whether a
   given athlete's "8" tends to precede an overshoot. Not in this design.
   Worth doing once there is enough logged history to estimate it, and it must
   surface as *evidence quality*, never as a label attached to a person.
3. **The coach cannot yet see per-section actual-vs-planned time**, which is
   a separate gap noted on 16 August and not addressed here.
