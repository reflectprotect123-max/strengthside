# MacroTrack

New repository for an Android nutrition tracker with a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose
client and Supabase/Postgres backend. The first vertical slice is the data and
adaptation foundation: Australian food imports, provenance-aware food records,
logging/recipe tables, weight trends, expenditure estimates, macro programs,
and weekly check-ins.

This is not a finished MacroFactor clone. The public product behaviour is
replicated as a deterministic contract where it is visible; private constants
and exact implementation details are not guessed.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10 or newer.
* `requests` only when using Open Food Facts API mode.
* No pandas or Excel package is required. XLSX files are read with the Python
  standard library. Binary `.xls` files must be saved as CSV/TSV/XLSX first.
* Android Studio with the Android 17/API 37 SDK for the Android module.

```bash
cd /workspace/macrotrack
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install requests
```

The Android module reads `SUPABASE_URL` and
`SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from a local `local.properties` file. That file is
ignored by Git and must never contain a service-role key.

```properties
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
```

Open the repository in Android Studio and sync the Gradle project. The current
starter uses the Compose compiler plugin, Kotlin 2.3.21, Compose BOM 2026.06.00,
AGP 9.3.0, and Gradle 9.5. The included workspace does not have an Android SDK
or Gradle installation, so Android compilation must be verified on the Android
development machine.

## Database setup

Apply the migration through the Supabase CLI or your normal migration runner:

```bash
supabase db push
```

The migration preserves the original `foods` columns and adds micronutrient
JSON, ingredients/allergens, source provenance, custom foods, recipes, food
logs, explicit incomplete/fasted day state, weights, trend points, macro
programs, expenditure estimates, check-ins, nutrient targets, measurements,
photos, and row-level security policies.

Use a service-role/admin connection for the bulk seed SQL. Do not expose that
credential in the Android client.

## Open Food Facts import

API mode filters for Australia and then post-filters for the Australian country
tag. It retries transient HTTP responses and writes batches of at most 500
rows:

```bash
python import_openfoodfacts.py \
  --output seed_foods_off.sql
```

For a reproducible local dump instead of the API:

```bash
python import_openfoodfacts.py \
  --input openfoodfacts-products.jsonl.gz \
  --output seed_foods_off.sql
```

To retain compatibility with the original eleven-column table before applying
the migration:

```bash
python import_openfoodfacts.py \
  --input openfoodfacts-products.jsonl.gz \
  --legacy-schema \
  --output seed_foods_off_legacy.sql
```

The importer skips missing barcode/name/macro records, converts kJ to kcal
only when kcal is absent and a kJ value is present, and refuses to invent a
gram↔millilitre density conversion. It also stores numeric source nutrients in
`foods.nutrients` and records a quality flag for fallbacks/conversions.

## AUSNUT, AFCD, or NUTTAB import

Current FSANZ download pages publish Excel files for food details, nutrient
profiles, and food measures. The importer also accepts the older AUSNUT
2011–13/NUTTAB layouts when their headers are present.

Example with AUSNUT-style files:

```bash
python import_ausnut.py \
  --nutrients "AUSNUT 2023 - Food nutrient profiles.xlsx" \
  --foods "AUSNUT 2023 - Food details.xlsx" \
  --measures "AUSNUT 2023 - Food measures.xlsx" \
  --output seed_foods_ausnut.sql
```

For a NUTTAB-style long nutrient table:

```bash
python import_ausnut.py \
  --source nuttab \
  --nutrients NUTTAB_Nutrient_File.csv \
  --foods NUTTAB_Food_File.csv \
  --output seed_foods_nuttab.sql
```

Generic foods have `barcode = NULL` and use the FSANZ food ID as
`external_id`. The importer writes a 100 g/ml fallback when no compatible
measure is available, not a guessed household-unit weight.

## Deterministic adaptive engine

The engine is a Python reference implementation to port into Kotlin. It uses:

1. smoothed weight trend rather than raw scale noise;
2. logged intake minus the energy represented by the trend slope;
3. explicit coverage gates (two consecutive seven-day periods with adequate
   nutrition and weight data);
4. holding states for incomplete data;
5. damped expenditure updates; and
6. signed goal rates for loss, maintenance, or gain, followed by configurable
   protein/fat preferences and carbohydrate allocation.

Run the example:

```bash
python adaptive_engine.py --input examples/checkin.json
```

The `EngineConfig` values are product parameters, not claims that they are
MacroFactor's private values. Keep them configurable and log the explanation
and inputs with each check-in so the Kotlin client can show a human-readable
decision trail.

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m py_compile *.py
```

## Honest feature boundary

This repository now contains the backend/data and deterministic decision
foundation. The following are intentionally still client/product work rather
than pretending they are already complete: Compose screens, camera barcode
integration, nutrition-label OCR, URL recipe extraction, photo/voice AI
logging, offline sync conflict resolution, notifications, and billing.

The public MacroFactor documentation describes deterministic intake/weight
adaptation, weekly check-ins, barcode/search/recipe logging, micronutrients,
body metrics, and progress photos. It does not publish enough detail to claim
that this repository has identical algorithms or identical UI behaviour.
