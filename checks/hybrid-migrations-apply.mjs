/*
 * Apply every migration to a REAL, throwaway Postgres and prove it works.
 *
 * The static checks in ecosystem-contract.mjs read migration TEXT. Text cannot
 * tell you that `20260807_nutrition_domain` is complete: the domain list it
 * widens is written in THREE places — the check constraint, the plpgsql body of
 * upsert_athlete_domain_snapshot, and the body of record_athlete_event — and
 * the RPCs are the only supported write path. A migration that widened only the
 * constraint would apply without error, pass every static assertion, and then
 * reject every nutrition write at runtime with `invalid domain`. That exact
 * mistake was written into the Phase 0 plan and caught here.
 *
 * So this runs the migrations in order against an empty database, then WRITES
 * through the RPCs and asserts the behaviour, including the negatives: a stale
 * revision must not overwrite, an unknown domain must still be refused.
 *
 * The MacroTrack food catalogue (20260807_macrotrack_food_catalogue) raises the
 * stakes: it is the first relational, per-athlete data in this project, and its
 * RLS is the ONLY thing standing between one athlete's food log and another's.
 * Reading the policy text proves nothing — a policy can be present, correct
 * looking, and still not applied because the role bypasses RLS or because a
 * foreign key reference walks around it. So this impersonates two distinct
 * athletes with real per-session auth.uid() values and asserts the boundary
 * empirically: shared catalogue readable by both, owned rows readable by
 * neither one's neighbour, and cross-owner references refused on write.
 *
 * Skipped unless a local postgres exists (initdb/pg_ctl on PATH), because it
 * needs a server it can own. Never points at a real project — it builds its own
 * cluster in a temp dir and destroys it.
 *
 * Run: node checks/migrations-apply.mjs
