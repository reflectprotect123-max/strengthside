# THE Hybrid System — athlete app (strengthside)

**One product:** the Hybrid HTML athlete app — spine (`@hybrid/brain`) + branches (Strength / Engine / Nutrition screens).

| Role | Path |
| --- | --- |
| **Brain (logic only)** | `packages/brain/` → bundled to `apps/athlete/brain-bundle.js` |
| **Edit UI** | `apps/athlete/` (`index.html`, `app.js`, `home.css`) |
| **Sync / build** | `bash scripts/sync-athlete-app.sh` |
| **Play locally** | open `apps/athlete/index.html` or `python3 -m http.server --directory apps/athlete` |
| **Deploy** | `apps/athlete/` → Netlify (`thehybridsystem.netlify.app`) |
| **Android** | `apps/mobile/capacitor/` wraps `apps/athlete/` |

## Coach workspace (separate surface)

The Hybrid athlete app (`index.html` / `THE-Hybrid-App.html`) is **not** this and is not edited. Athletes keep logging there. This page is coach-only: Home feed, roster, library, program/session builders, assign-to-team.

```bash
cd apps/mobile/prototype/hybrid-app
python3 -m http.server 4173
# http://localhost:4173/coach.html
```

Coach demo: `dan@thehybrid.local` / `demo`

Seeded roster (visible on Coach Home, not a login here): team **hybrid S&C**, athlete Dan Veldman, program **Hybrid Strength Base**, one completed session (Dan Veldman, Week 1 Day 1). This is the last good coach suite from `848074a` (parent of the park-coach commit).

## Brains (not a second app)

- **`packages/brain/`** — hub logic (readiness, today’s call, coach context). Zero I/O.
- **`packages/adaptive/`** — engine math (Open/Next/Close). Bundled to `apps/athlete/adaptive-bundle.js`.
- **`packages/strength-engine/`** — pure lift logic (resolve, e1RM, WM, PR). Wire into screens later.
- **`supabase/migrations/`** — owned Postgres tables (shared with the Brain repo). See `CLAUDE.md`.
